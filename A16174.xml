            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I doe volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily confeſſe, that after I had ſeene <hi>M. Abbots</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to my Epiſtle vnto his Majeſty, I was a long time vnwilling to reply vpon it; not for that I eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it to containe any ſuch extraordinary learning, as be too too fondly vaunteth off (for I dare be bold to ſay, that in a skilful mans judgement, there are more pregnant proofes of their new doctrine in two leaues of <hi>M. Perkins</hi> booke, then in tenne of his:) but cleane contrary, I finde ſo little ſubſtance in his worke, and ſo great ſtore of impertinent and vile ſtuffe, ſuch ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity of idle amplifications, ſo many vnciuil and foule wordes; that I could not thinke the time wel beſtowed, which ſhould be ſpent in ſo friuolous and paine an altercation. Notwithſtanding being often admoniſhed by my friendes, that diuers Protestants much commended <hi>M. Abbots</hi> diſcourſe, ſome for the ſtile, and his cunning and confident carriage in it; others for that they ſaw it thicke interlaced with ſundry ancient Authors ſentences: and thereby thought and gaue out, that he refuſed not to deale with vs at our owne weapons. Herevpon I reſolued at length to afford it ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, ſpecially for ſuch good peoples ſake, who are deſirous to bolt out that truth of God, which only can ſaue their ſoules, and are not willing to be deceiued with fine tricks, nor doe wittingly ſuffer themſelues to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with faire glozing ſpeeches, or ſtout brags, when they finde no correspondence of ſound and wel grounded matter. To giue the man his due, I acknowledge that he inditeth not amiſſe, if he did not defile and poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon his penne with ſo huge a multitude of ougly, venimous, and vnſauoury
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14423:3"/> tearmes. But what account is to be made of choiſe, picked, and pleaſing wordes, when they be imployed not only to abuſe and beguile ſimple ſoules, but alſo to diſgrace the ſincere verity of Gods word? ſurely for the deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of controuerſies in religion, plaine vſual ſpeeches without painting or ſuperfluity, haue alwaies beene taken by the learned for most decent and expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, according to that ancient Adage: <hi>ſimplex eſt veritatis oratio, the ſtile of truth is ſimple and plaine.</hi> And where much colouring and flouriſhing is vſed, there is no ſmal ſuspition of a badde cauſe and fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent dealing. What neede bad <hi>M. Abbot</hi> to fil vp thirty ſheetes of paper, to giue anſwere vnto one ſheete and halfe of mine? doth it not argue to a man of vnderſtanding, that what he could not anſwere vnto directly in few wordes, he would at leaſt cloake with long circumſtances, and caſt a mist before the Readers eies with gay glorious phraſes, that he might not ſee and diſcerne the truth?</p>
            <p>Touching his frequent diſgraceful and odious tearmes, and most bitter rayling againſt the best ſort of men on our ſide, I would gladly learne how it can ſtand with Christian charity and modeſty. Sure I am, that it conſorteth ful euil with that ſacred rule of the Apoſtle:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 24.</note> 
               <hi>The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of our Lord muſt not wrangle, but be milde towardes al men, apt to teach, patient, with modeſty admoniſhing them that reſiſt the truth.</hi> And <hi>S.

               <hi>To be modeſt and humble, and not ſo much as to render euil for euil, or curſe for curſe:</hi> ſo farre off was he from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging any man to reuile and raile at them, who neuer gaue him any one foule word in al their liues, yea whome he neuer ſaw. And he further biddeth vs to follow the example of Christ our great maſter, <hi>who did not reuile, when he was reuiled:</hi> but hath in expreſſe wordes forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vs to vſe any contemptuous or opprobrious ſpeeches againſt our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren, aſſuring vs before hand, that he<note place="margin">

He without doubt may garniſh his margent with variety of quotations, that bluſheth not to cite ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently as <hi>M. Abbot</hi> doth, ſuch partial writers. But no man (I hope) wil be ſo fooliſh, as to giue credit vnto any thing that is no better verified, then by the verdict of ſuch falſe witneſſes. For to cal one of them to giue testimony is no better, then (after our Engliſh prouerbe) to hidde a man aske one of his fellowes, whether he be a theefe or no.</p>
            <p>Againe, there is another circumſtance in the citing of his late partial authors, which maketh it yet more abſurd and ridiculous. For he ſticketh not to produce the credit of a ſeely writer of this last hundred yeares, for verification of a matter done more then a thouſand yeares before he was borne. For example, to proue that Pope <hi>Eleutherius</hi> acknowledged <hi>Lucius</hi> (King of our Country <hi>1400.</hi> yeares past) to be ſupreame gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in cauſes Eccleſiaſtical,<note place="margin">

               <hi>M. Abbot</hi> alleageth <hi>Holinſhed</hi> a Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cler of our age: what a jest is this? how knew this late writer what paſſed ſo long before his owne time? was there not any one Hyſtoriographer more ancient then he, neither Latin nor Engliſh, that could tel any tidings of ſuch a matter? And yet <hi>M. Abbot</hi> is ſo il aduiſed, as to perſwade vs to receiue it vpon his ſeely poore credit. Of the like ſtuffe is that in another place of his booke,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Page</hi> 60.</note> to wit, that <hi>Syritius</hi> Biſhop of Rome (who liued about <hi>1200.</hi> yeares agoe) was a noueller, and that by the worſhipful verdict of <hi>Polidore Virgil:</hi> who liued eleauen hundred yeares after him. What, are learned men growne ſo careleſſe of their credit, that they dare let paſſe to the print ſuch doting follies, and ſo groſſe abſurdities? this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14423:4"/> may ſerue for a note of his ouerſight, in alleadging his owne pew-fellowes for vpright and indifferent vmpeers, and late moderne authors for the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainety of ancient matters.</p>
            <p>Now to his citations of the more authentike approued writers, whome he doth greatly abuſe in diuers and ſundry faſhions. The first and moſt gentle is, when he doth cite their wordes truly, but doth apply them cleane contrary to their meaning. For example, in his Epiſtle to the Kinges Majeſty be approueth his Highneſſe courſe for the anſwering of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like bookes, producing for it this ſentence out of <hi>S. Bernard: That though thereby the Heretike ariſe not from his filth, yet the Church may be confirmed in her faith: M. Abbot</hi> meaning as the ſequele of his ſpeech doth import, that if thereby men of the Roman reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion wil not be conuerted from their errors, yet the good Proteſtants may be confirmed in their new faith: which is very farre wide from <hi>S. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardes</hi> expreſſe declaration; as elſe-where, ſo in that very place. For that deuout holy Father was ſo farre off from diſſwading any man from the Roman faith, that he wiſheth al men to make their recourſe vnto the See of Rome, for reſolution of al doubts in faith: theſe be his wordes to Pope Innocentius. <hi>We muſt referre to your Apoſtleſhip,</hi>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14423:5"/> Roman religion ſo ſtrongly eſtabliſhed by that reuerend religious Father in the very ſame place. This may ſuffice for a proofe of his miſapplying the Fathers ſentences, wherein he offendeth as often and as grieuouſly (I thinke) as euer did any Christian writer, as ſhal be hereafter ſhewed.</p>
            <p>Now to another tricke of his no leſſe ſhameful, which is the miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruing of their wordes: let this ſerue for a paterne.

Thirdly, theſe wordes are most falſly and fondly applied to vs Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Prieſts: for firſt that falſe God of Antichriſt ſhal not be aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Romans, but fought againſt, and foiled by them, as it is cleare in the very text.<note place="margin">

            <p>And laſtly, how il aduiſed was <hi>M.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14423:9"/> as ſome others, if they would follow the current of the time: Yea, they doe alſo debarre themſelues of landes, legacies, annuities, and al other profits and commodities whatſoeuer, which might accrew vnto them, from their parents, kinsfolkes, and friendes; being content to liue vpon Gods prouidence, and that poore pittance which the impoueriſhed eſtate of ſome few Catholikes wil afford them. The Proteſtant Ministers, who by their profeſsion are capable of fat benefices, headſhips of houſes, Deana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſuch like dignities and commodities, may be truly ſuspected to bend their ſtudies that way, and to maintaine hereſies in hope of gaine and promotion: and they who cannot be ſatisfied with two or three of thoſe great liuings joyned togither, or with one Biſhoprick alone, but would haue Biſhoprickes and Deanaries vnited; ſuch men may indeede rightly be ſuſpected, to make marchandize of mens ſoules for filthy lucres ſake: but to impute couetouſneſſe vnto ſeminary Prieſts, who haue debarred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of al preferment both ſpiritual and temporal, which their Country yeeldeth to men of their profeſsion, and can looke for no other promotion there, then a halter at Tyburne, was no leſſe ſhameful then witleſſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency. Briefly, <hi>M. Abbot</hi> by tearing Gods wordes in peeces, and patching it vp againe with his owne wordes ful il-fauouredly, and by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying it moſt abſurdly, is found to offer as great injury to it, as he hath done vnto thoſe holy ancient learned Fathers aforeſaid; who were by the ſpirit of God ſelected to be the principal expounders of it. So that finally, whether you regard the handling of Scriptures or Fathers, you ſhal ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome light vpon any Diuine that doth performe it more inſufficiently (ſhal I ſay) or more perfidiouſly: neuertheleſſe he ſets ſuch a braſen face on the matter; ſpeaketh ſo confidently; conueieth it ſo cunningly; and doth gild it ouer ſo artificially, that the credulous and vnwary reader would thinke him to be ſome jolly fellow, and a rare flouriſhing writer. But be that wil not take vaine wordes for good paiment, nor tricks and ſhifts for ſufficient proofes; but wil weigh his arguments wel, and diligently exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine his teſtimonies: he ſhal quickly diſcouer <hi>M. Abbots</hi> weakeneſſe, and finde him to be one of the most ſhallow and beggerlieſt writers of theſe daies: for he like a mount-banke indeede (to returne his owne wordes vpon him) ſetteth out for freſh and new marchandize, the very rif-raf and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe of other Proteſtant authors, and that which hath beene an hundred times anſwered vnto by the learned on our ſide.

               <p>Here I am only to note how <hi>M. Abbot</hi> ſlandereth me in this place, with that whereof he himſelfe cleareth me afterwards in his booke: Let vs goe on vvith his reproches. He ſaith; <hi>That we be but ſicophants, and hirelings to the Pope, for whoſe ſake we must gale and diſgrace, howſoeuer there be no truth in that we ſpeake.</hi> How proueth he this? is it not the part of a notable ſicophant indeede, to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braide a vvhole order of men vvith ſo great crimes, vvithout any proofe at al? How many learned Catholike writers be there in the world, that neuer receiued one peny from the Popes holyneſſe, no nor neuer ſo much as ſaw him, or had any particular dealings with him? what they doe out of their duty towardes God, and of zeale to his ſacred truth, that <hi>M.

But we ſay, that by the Catholike doctrine, al ſubjects conſciences are rightly informed in the waies of God, and thereby inſtructed to be true and faithful to their Princes, and to hate al ſuch practiſes, as tend to the perturbation of the vveale publike.

                  </note> for they hold, that Chriſtian liberty alloweth al men the free vſe of al thinges indifferent, and that ſuch thinges may not be made neceſſary in conſcience; ſo that if the Prince goe about to reſtraine his ſubjects of that liberty, they are not bound to obey him: vvhereas we al maintaine, that al men are bound in conſcience to obey al ſuch juſt lawes of Princes, as are not directly againſt the law of God: our doctrine therefore, doth farre excel the Proteſtants, in the matter of true loialty.</p>
               <p>And to anſwere here by the vvay, to that odious argument of theirs; <hi>That the Papiſts</hi> (forſooth) <hi>are but halfe ſubjects, becauſe in matters of religion they are not ruled by their King and his lawes, but doe depend vpon the Pope:</hi> I ſay, that if al they, who in matters of faith and ſaluation, doe not take their temporal Prince to be their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme gouernour, ſhould be eſteemed but halfe ſubjects: then the mighty Monarkes of France and Spaine, and al other Catholike Kings or Princes of the vvorld, haue not any one whole ſubject; for none of their people acknowledge them for chiefe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manders in Eccleſiaſtical cauſes: then alſo for a thouſand yeares together, our former Kinges were wholy deſtitute of true and loial ſubjects; for they depended no leſſe then we doe vpon the Biſhop of Rome, for declaration and deciſion of ſpiritual affaires, as it is very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly demonſtrated, in that learned anſwere vnto S<hi rend="sup">r.</hi>

The firſt is, that he auoucheth my only feare and conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, to be the conſtant opinion of al Catholikes; <hi>they haue beene bold</hi> ſaith he, vvhen he citeth my only vvordes vvriting in mine owne name: wherefore he doeth open wrong to others, to impute that to them whereunto they were not acceſſary; if there be any ouerſight committed in it, it is mine alone, and not any other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. <hi>M. Abbots</hi> ſecond vntruth, is couched in theſe wordes: <hi>If your Majeſty wil not yeeld them what they deſire,</hi> which are farre wide from that which I wrote: for I ſaid not, if vve may not haue what we deſire (vvhich vvere not only a tolleration, but a perfect reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Catholike faith) but if poore innocent Catholikes, ſhould for their conſcience ſake only be ſtripped of al their goods, depriued of their liberty, and liue alwaies in deepe diſgrace, and eminent danger of their liues, without any hope of amendment; that then at length God knoweth <hi>what neceſſity may driue them vnto:</hi> this you ſee is farre different, from that which <hi>M. Abbot</hi> relateth.</p>
               <p>Now to the third and moſt ſpiteful lie of al the reſt: that <hi>if they may not obtaine what they deſire by faire meanes, then they wil with fire and ſworde enforce it;</hi> which I neither ſaid nor thought, as God the ſearcher of al harts doth beſt know: I only ſignified a farre off, and that vnder theſe doubtful tearmes (God knowes,) that it vvas not vnlike (conſidering the frailty of mans corrupt nature) but that ſuch extreame vſage, might perhaps prouoke and ſtirre vp ſome impatient and fiery ſpirits, to vndergoe ſome certaine attempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome of them, whom they tooke to be the principal procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of their miſery; which other good Catholikes would be right ſorry to ſee, and might peraduenture greatly rue. This being the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:14423:16"/> vttermoſt of my meaning, and my wordes in reaſonable conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction not importing any thing more, vvas it not the part of a veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſpider, to ſuck ſo peſtilent poiſon out of it? That vulgar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe to vvhich I alluded: <hi>Durum telum neceſsitas,</hi> or as it is in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, <hi>Neceſſity hath no law,</hi> is approued of al men: and the prudent Polititian hath obſerued, that <hi>Patientia laeſa vertitur in furorem; Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to much preſſed doth turne into fury.</hi> Out of which and the like Axiomes of the wiſe, and ouer frequent putting them in practiſe by the vnwiſe; a man of ſmal prouidence might, if not eaſily fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, yet greatly ſuſpect and feare, leaſt ſuch vrgent extreamitie vvithout any hope of redreſſe, vvould make ſome euil mortified men, forget their duty to both God and man, and runne head-long into ſome miſchief. On the other ſide, al men that doe treate of the methode of perſwaſion, doe inſtruct him that is to deale in that kinde, to propoſe aſwel the inconueniences that may enſue, if that be not done vvhich he exhorteth vnto, as the commodities that wil ariſe of the doing of it; and vvhen this is performed in decent tearmes and dutiful manner, none but wrangling cauillers can take any exception againſt it: Now, further to rack and vvreſt it into ſo odious a ſenſe, as <hi>M. Abbot</hi> doth, muſt needes conuince him to be a very virulent calumniator. Let vs put the caſe, that thoſe ſage Counſellors, vvho aduiſed King <hi>Roboam</hi> to deale more gratiouſly with his people, then his Father had done before him, ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had vſed other reaſons to perſwade him thereunto, haue added this to moue him the ſooner to condeſcend to his ſubjects ſute: <hi>That if he did then refuſe to grant that their earneſt requeſt, God knoweth what they might thereupon be moued to doe;</hi> had they beene vvorthy to be ſtiled falſe traitors for their labour, if out of their feare of future miſhaps, they had put their Prince in mind of them beforehand, that he might being ſo warned the better preuent and auoide them?

Doe not they then ſhewe themſelues no kinde children of <hi>Abraham</hi> (the Father of al true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers,) nor to haue any Chriſtian compaſſion or good nature in them, who are ſo farre off from ſuing out the offendours pardon, for the ſakes of many harmeleſſe perſons, that they would cleane contrary, haue thouſands of innocents deſtroied for the treſpaſſe of ſome dozen of delinquents? and if this wil not ſerue to purge and cleanſe their feſtred ſtomackes, of that euil affection vvith which their preachers haue infected them, I then doe moſt hartily requeſt them, to ſuppoſe for a ſeaſon, the caſe to be their owne; and then to tel me, whether they would thinke it reaſon, that they ſhould be taken for acceſſary to al treaſons committed by men of their owne religion.

               <p>For anſwere vnto the later ſurmiſe: If it had taken effect, it had blowne vp aſwel Catholikes as Proteſtants, and that in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; vvho the firſt day of the Parliament, are wont to preſſe into that place to heare his Majeſties ſpeech: wherefore, Catholikes could not haue beene glad of that, vvhich ſhould haue deuoured ſo many of their owne profeſſion. Againe, ſuppoſe al the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had beene blowne vp (vvhich God of his great goodneſſe preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted) how much the nearer had the Catholikes beene to haue obtained the eſtabliſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of their religion, the body of the realme being againſt them, and would for that bloudy and barbarous act, haue hated them much more then euer before it did? ſo that it hath no probability, that the wiſer ſort of Catholikes would haue beene glad, that that ſhould haue beene brought to paſſe, which would haue proued ſo hurtful to ſo many of them, without any certainty to haue benefited the reſt. This therefore is only a malitious and odious ſurmiſe, put vpon them by their backe-friends at pleaſure. To the other point vvhich is of very great moment (if is were any way probable) I anſwere; that al the circumſtances of the matter, doe fully cleere and acquite al other Catholikes of that crime: for firſt the vvhole proceſſe of the offendors, is ſet out in print by his Highneſſe authority, where twelue or thirteene perſons only, are proued to haue beene priuy, conſenting, and acceſſary to it; who were al and euery one of them, bound by oath and Sacrament not to communicate or vtter the ſame to any other: ſo that al others being kept from ſo much as the knowledge of it, how could they be conſenting to that they knew not? Secondly, his Majeſty both by publike ſpeech in the Parliament, and by proclamation in the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:14423:19"/> country did declare; that there were many Catholikes innocent of this treaſon, yea ſome of them as forwardly to diſcouer and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the offenders, as any other ſubjects: theſe be his Highnes one ſpeeches, which are very memorable in a Proclamation of the 7. of Nouemb. 1603. <hi>Although we are by good experience, ſo wel perſwaded of the loialty of diuers of our ſubjects (though not profeſsing true religion) that they doe as much abhorre this deteſtable conspiracy, as our ſelues; and wilbe ready to doe their beſt endeauours (though with exſpence of their bloud) to ſuppreſſe al attempts againſt our ſafty, &amp;c.</hi> vvhere alſo his Majeſty out of his Princely equity commanded, that the innocent ſhould not be wrongfully vexed about it. Thirdly, that moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant and prudent Counſellour, the right Honorable Earle of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſbury now Lord Treaſurer, (who was like to looke as farre into this plot as any other) in his eloquent diſcourſe printed, doth not only free other Catholikes from that conſpiracy; but alſo yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a very probable argument therefore, to wit: <hi>That the conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators riſing in a country where many of their religion are thought to dwel none</hi> (excepting ſome few of their owne ſeruants and kinſmen) <hi>would aide or aſsiſt them;</hi> Yea, many ſent their men and armour to purſue and apprehend them, which was a manifeſt proof that they abhorred from that practiſe: for in any ordinary quarrel, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of half a dozen of them might quickly haue found many more to haue taken his part, then al they could get together to aſſiſt them in that hateful enterpriſe. This might be yet further fortified if neede were, by the teſtimony of <hi>S<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Edward Cooke</hi> (now chiefe Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the common pleas, then Atturney general) who in his plea againſt the delinquents, deliuereth the very ſame obſeruation; <hi>That none of their religion would take part with them therein.</hi> Al which, proceeding from ſuch principal perſons; who were, as of beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence in thoſe affaires, ſo nothing partial in fauouring that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: how then can any man of meane vnderſtanding be yet hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in that groſſe error, that al Catholikes were conſenting, or any way priuy to that powder-treaſon? And if al Proteſtants that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue ſo vncharitable an opinion of their poore afflicted country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, be to blame; how much more are thoſe preachers to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, who (notwithſtanding the publike notice thereof giuen out in print, of which they could not be ignorant) haue euer ſince, and doe not yet ceaſſe, to cry out, infame, and ſlander al Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes

Now let any man of wit judge, whether the Catholikes or Proteſtants doe moſt reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them; yea, who can deny, but that the Proteſtants doe almoſt in euery point follow them at the heeles? For firſt, the Proteſtants teach euen as they did, that Chriſtes viſible Church was periſhed (for the inuiſible Church the Donatiſts held, could not periſh as <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> witneſſeth) for 900.<note place="margin">Aug. in pſal. <hi>101.</hi> cap. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> yeares at the leaſt al the vvorld ouer, and is euen now wholy decaied in al other parts of the world, ſauing where their doctrine is embraced: and this was the maine
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:14423:22"/> point of the Donatiſts hereſie. Secondly, though al the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants doe not rebaptiſe, yet one part of them (to wit the Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſts) doe vſe it. For the Proteſtants be deuided into Lutherans, Sacramentaries, and Anabaptiſts, (to omit Trinitarians and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,) euen as the Donatiſts were into Donatiſts, Rogatiſts, and Maximianiſts. Thirdly, diuers of their principal teachers, as <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon, Caluin,</hi> and many others, doe corrupt the ſound doctrine of the moſt ſacred Trinity, as I haue ſhewed in the Preface of the ſecond part of the Reformation of a deformed Catholike; though the common ſort of them, doe not greatly obſerue it. Fourthly, for plucking downe of Churches, abuſing the moſt bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, holy Oiles, and al holy ornaments that belonged to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes Churches, the Proteſtants are not behinde, but goe farre beyond the Donatiſts. Laſtly, they haue alſo compounded and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a new kinde of Pſalmes, called Geneua Pſalmes, to be ſonge before their ſermons. See <hi>M. Abbot</hi> how jointly the Donatiſts and Proteſtants walke as it were hand in hand together: ſhew not your ſelfe therefore, ſo vndutiful a childe to your natural parents, as not to acknowledge them for ſuch; for you are euen as like vnto them in the face and whole feature of both doctrine and manners, as if you had beene ſpit out of their mouthes. Doe not for very ſhame hit vs in the teeth any more vvith the Donatiſts, before you haue by as ſound vvitneſſes, proued vs to participate with them in the proper qualities of their profeſſion. <hi>To be wily like Aspes, and to rage like Lions,</hi> are not the peculiar recognizances and badges of their ſect; but may agree vnto many others, and perhaps to few other more truly then to Proteſtants: who when they be vnder, as they haue beene in England, and are now in the greateſt King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of Europe, they are as wily as Foxes, the greateſt commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of clemency that may be; no man is then to be puniſhed for his conſcience, ſpecially they that ſeeke after nothing but refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of mens manners, and the purity of the Goſpel: but vvhen they are gotten vp, and ſit at the ſterne of gouernement, the caſe is cleane altered, they become then as fierce as Lions. Our Fathers were beguiled by their vvilineſſe, vve feele their open profeſſed violence; and were it not for the moderation of the chiefe Pilot, and ſome others in authority, I feare the vvorld ſhould quickly perceiue, how Lion-like they would rage: thus much by the way,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:14423:23"/> to diſcouer how impertinently and vntruly, <hi>M. Abbot</hi> doth cite the ancient Doctors ſentences. If he thought their vvordes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for his purpoſe, though they vſed them not in the ſame ſence as he doth, he might wel haue vſed the like wordes; but he ought in no caſe to adde the Fathers authority, when they meant no ſuch matter as he citeth their wordes for. But what wil you? neceſſity hath no law: either he muſt haue omitted their authority, and ſo haue put foorth a leane, barren, and penurious peece of worke, not worth the looking on; or elſe ſo vſe and abuſe their wordes, as he doth. For in their true meaning, they vvil afford neither him nor any Proteſtant any fauour or defence at al.</p>
               <p>To draw now to the concluſion of his Epiſtle: I haue not vvith any calumnious libel, traduced and ſlandered the Proteſtants do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but haue out of my duty towardes Gods truth, and loue of my deare country-mens ſaluation, very truly, and in as faire ſort as I could, ſet downe the errours of their deuiſes; that the wel minded amongſt them, may by the helpe of Gods grace the better perceiue them, beware of them, and fly from them in time, leaſt they draw them along with them, into euerlaſting damnation. Which my dutiful endeauours, if the enemies of truth doe calumniate, and loade with opprobrious lies and ſlanders, I muſt take it patiently, and comfort my ſelfe with theſe ſacred wordes of our ſweet Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Bleſſed be you when they ſhal reuile you, and perſecute you, and ſpeake al that is naught against you, vntruly for my ſake; be glad and rejoice, for your reward is very great in heauen: for ſo they perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Prophets that were before you.</hi> Now whereas <hi>M. Abbot</hi> ſaith in his owne commendation, that he carrieth himſelfe in this worke of his, <hi>faithfully and vprightly as to God and his Prince:</hi> I am ſorry to ſee him make ſo ſlender reckoning both of his faith to <hi>God,</hi> and fealty to his <hi>Prince;</hi> for by this that hath beene already ſaid, and much more by that which followeth ſhal it appeare, that he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no conſcience to dally vvith Gods vvord, and to mangle it moſt pitifully; to abuſe the holy Fathers ſentences by al manner of meanes, that any graceleſſe creature can doe; to caſt moſt wrongfully al kinde of contumelies, taunts, and ſlanders vpon Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, that he could deuiſe; and finally to incenſe his moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Majeſty, to bathe his ſworde in the bloud of innocents: This may be peraduenture, to behaue himſelfe like a true Miniſter
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:14423:23"/> of the new Goſpel. But if he cal this faithful and vpright carriage, as to God and his Prince; as I am ſure he can looke for no reward of God for ſuch leude behauiour, who cannot be deceiued: ſo I doubt not, but if his Majeſties leaſure would permit him to peruſe <hi>M. Abbots</hi> railing and vnlearned writinges, peſtred with innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of palpable vntruthes, he ſhould thereby picke ſmal thankes at his Highneſſe handes. Thus vviſhing (no leſſe then any Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant whoſoeuer) perfect knowledge of Gods truth vnto his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and grace from heauen to embrace, maintaine, and defend it, vvith al happineſſe vnto his Highneſſe raigne ouer vs: I end my anſwere vnto <hi>M.

But taking the ſooneſt and best oportunity that I could, after that I had gone ouer ſome good part of the booke, to furniſh my ſelfe with ſuch matter as ſhould ſerue for confutation of it; at length about the beginning of Iuly, being deſirous to bring ſomewhat to effect, I addreſſed my ſelfe with al inſtant endeauour, to giue anſwere to the Epiſtle Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to the Kings most excellent Majeſty: which as I accounted the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal matter in the booke; ſo I held it my duty, to vſe very ſpecial care for the repulſing of thoſe calumnies and ſlanders, which the author hath gathered

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>OVRTEOVS Reader, I would haue let paſſe this nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration as impertinent, had it beene ſomewhat more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable: but becauſe it diſcouereth and ſetteth foorth the humour of the man, it is worth the noting. I beare with that inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gruity; <hi>It was now in Ianuary laſt past:</hi> if it were <hi>now</hi> which deſigneth the time preſent, how was it in Ianuary then paſt? but I take his meaning, that it vvas in Ianuary paſt before he had ſeene my booke; vvhich though he ſay not directly, but that my booke was then ſent to him, yet he would haue his reader take it ſo, that he might thereby and by that vvhich followeth, gather vvhat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition he had vſed in the anſwering of it; wherein he giueth him vvrong to vnderſtand. For two monethes before that, the booke vvas common to be had, and great communication about the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering of it, in the place of his abode: and either he or one of his name, had in ſhort marginal notes aſſaied to giue anſwere vnto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny points of the ſame epiſtle, by that very Ianuary. But admit that he ſaw not the booke before, why did he not then goe in hand with it, hauing receiued ſtraight commandement from ſo high a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, to vſe al expedition for the anſwering of it? Forſooth the Barber-ſurgeon hauing his ſoare eies in cure, would not giue him leaue to doe it. Is it likely that the L. Archbiſhop was ſo euil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of his eſtate, that he would require him to make a ſpeedy anſwere to a booke, before he knew that he was in caſe to reade it? But his Lordſhips letters perhaps, found <hi>M. Abbot</hi> (according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſeaſon of the yeare) frozen, and could not as then vvorke in him any great reſolution to anſwere: but the ſpring following, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne

Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this vvere vvonderful celerity, if we might be ſo bold as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue him; but vntil he make better proofe of his fidelity, he muſt pardon vs if in haſt we giue not credit vnto him. For vvho can perſwade himſelfe, that <hi>M.

But the man meaning in this Preface to commend himſelfe aboue the skies, ſaw that it was neceſſary to remoue this ſtumbling-block out of the vvay, and before hand to excuſe his extreame ſlowneſſe; that it might not ſeeme ſtrange, how ſo admirable quicke a pen-man, ſhould be holden occupied ſo long time about ſo little.</p>

For hauing to doe with a juditious and learned Prince, who is wel able (God be than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked) rightly to cenſure what he writeth; without doubt, if he had made this his project to compaſſe the obtaining of his requeſt, he vvould haue dealt ſincerely, and faithfully; he vvould haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne our church; al vnjuſt and ſlanderous imputations; he would not haue ſought, by apparant vntruth and falſhood, to juſtifie his badde cauſe; he vvould haue had care ſo to carry himſelfe, that his Majeſty ſeing nothing but true and plaine dealing, might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vvhat is amiſſe, to haue proceeded only from ſimplicity of errour, not from any obſtinate and wilful malice againſt the truth.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:14423:31"/> once paſſed the bounds of modesty, careth not to become exceeding im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent.</hi> For vvho hath made <hi>M.

If their religion be not acquited and cleered of thoſe imputations, before I in my conſcience purge it of them, no doubt but it muſt alwaies ſtand juſtly charged with them: ſee the Preface vnto the ſecond part of the reformed Catholike, wherein I haue deliuered mine opinion of their religion concerning thoſe points.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.

               <p>I Was bold in my Preface (according to the common cuſtome of writers) to commend my booke to the reader, that he might the more vvillingly reade it ouer with diligence; and I ſhewed before vvhat I meant when I ſaid: <hi>That he ſhould there finde the marrow and pith of many volumes, drawne into a narrow roome.</hi> For whereas di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers men, haue ſet out vvhole volumes of one only controuerſie, ſome of the ſupremacy, others of the bleſſed Sacrament, diuers men of ſundry queſtions; in my booke ſhould be treated of many great controuerſies, and the principal arguments of thoſe matters compriſed in them: for on the Proteſtants ſide, <hi>M. Perkins</hi> (as I there ſaid) had collected their choiſe arguments, vvhich al were related in my booke, beſides their anſweres; and ſome of the beſt
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:14423:33"/> (according to my ſlender choiſe and skil) propoſed in defence and fauour of the Catholike party. Wherefore, I did not much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede vvhen I ſaid; that the ſumme and ſubſtance of many large bookes, ſhould be contracted into that ſmal one of mine, meaning aſwel of the Proteſtant authors as of the Catholike: vvherefore <hi>M. Abbots</hi> amplification of it, is both idle and falſe; for I ſent them as wel the creame of their owne arguments, as the flower of ours. Neither did I challenge any man as he fableth, much leſſe did I like Goliath defie the hoſt of Iſrael: but doe only giue anſwere to an Iſmaelite, who counterfaiting the Iſraelite, doth take vpon him to reforme them that are better informed then himſelfe. There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then no juſt cauſe, why <hi>M. Abbot</hi> ſhould vſe theſe ſuperfluous wordes, wil you giue me leaue to aime at this vaine-glorious mans meaning? In this reſembling of his aduerſary to Goliath, vvould he not thereby (thinke you) haue his reader imagine, that he as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <hi>Dauid</hi> was choſen out of the hoſt of Iſrael, to encounter with this great Goliath? And what maruaile, though he that durſt equal himſelfe to <hi>S.

               <p>Is not that which followeth a ſtrange tale? <hi>That my ſtudies haue beene more interrupted by contention with the Ieſuites, then perſecuted by the Proteſtants,</hi> vvhereas they haue beene rather furthered, then hindred by thoſe diſputes betweene the Ieſuites and vs, about the gouernement of the Church; vvhich gaue vs great occaſion, to looke better into that noble knowledge of the Eccleſiaſtical Hier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy, then euer we did before. And as in times paſt we had vvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly reaped no ſmal commodity, both in their vvel ordered ſchooles, and out of their very learned vvriters: euen ſo now vpon

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ieſuites did rather aduance our ſtudies, then any way per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute them: whereas on the other ſide, the Proteſtants vvil ſuffer vs to reſt in no place, vvhere we may ſtudy, and further doe ſeeke by al the waies that the wit of man can deuiſe, how to depriue vs of al meanes to maintaine our ſtudies: with what face then could this man ſay, that our ſtudies vvere more interrupted by the Ieſuites, then by them? He addeth, that <hi>they wel deſerue perſecution, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy mens ſoules, extinguiſh the true conſcience of alleageance,</hi> &amp;c. vvhich is true, but concerneth themſelues more then vs: for rather Proteſtants then Catholikes be ſuch, as I haue heretofore in ſundry places proued; and therefore doe not ſtand vpon it here, vvhere he only affirmeth it after his manner without any proofe.</p>

And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be a maruailous pretious ornament in a Prince, to be ſo humane and clement, yet many haue beene excellent therein, vvhom <hi>the Lord</hi> did not chooſe for his. The Emperours <hi>Traian, Marcus Aurelius,</hi> and <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> were of a moſt courteous, milde, and moderate diſpoſition; yet being Heathens, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the courſe of their Predeceſſors lawes, were not altogether free from the ſpilling of ſome innocent bloud of the Chriſtians. But let vs allow clemency to be one of the richeſt jewels in a Princes Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme: vvho then is to be accounted a more true harted and loial ſubject, either I that endeuoured earneſtly to perſwade my Prince, to keepe, cheriſh, and encreaſe that pretious gift of clemency in him, vvhich doth ſo highly adorne his roial Majeſty; or he that emploieth his whole wit, art, and skil, to depriue his Highneſſe of the glory of thoſe gratious giftes, and to incenſe him to al rigour and ſeuerity? If any men of our religion, by ſeditious and diſloial behauiour ſhal deſerue ſeuerity, let them be ſeuerely puniſhed: and if any be found ſo vnreaſonable as to cry out againſt it, vpbraide them hardly vvith that their folly.

               <p>HERE is ſuch a tedious tale, ſo impertinent, ſo improbable, that I could ſcarce endure the vvriting of it out; yet that he ſhould not complaine that any thing is omitted, I haue put it al downe. That part of it concerning M. Archprieſts ordination, is

               <p>To the other of titles <hi>M.

For vvhat other meanes hath he to be priuy to our inward thoughts and meaninges, vnleſſe it be by reuelation from heauen? of vvhich vvhen he can reſolue me I wil thinke him vvorthy of a further anſwere: In the meane ſeaſon, he muſt be ſenceleſſe, that wil beleeue the ſecular Prieſts to haue bin ſo ſimple, that they expected greater preferment vnder his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, profeſſing and maintaining the new religion, then they could looke for vnder the <hi>Infanta,</hi> that would haue ſet vp the old. For al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>beit the ſecular Prieſts, had not beene aduanced vnto any of the greater liuings and dignities; yet it could not be, but that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt amongſt them ſhould haue had twenty times more, the ſtate being Catholike, then being as it now is. And if <hi>M.

If it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, how we Catholike Prieſts could perſwade our ſelues, ſo much to reſpect and loue a Prince, that was like to doe ſo little for vs, and to employ our pennes and paines for him, that might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:14423:38"/> little eſteeme of it. I anſwere, that he being by lawful ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to be our King, our duty obliged vs to affect him. Againe, for his moſt bleſſed Mothers ſake, who liued and died ſo vertuouſly, we could not but loue and honour him whom ſhee loued moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly. Thirdly, the Princely endowments which God had large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly powred vpon his Majeſty, and ſpecially his rare literature, did draw the harts of al men that fancied learning, to fauour him. Fourthly, we did euen then fore-ſee, vvhat bloudy warres and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine garboils were like to haue conſumed our whole country, if ſuch oppoſition ſhould haue beene made againſt him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought it better to ſeeke his Princely fauour towardes our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and ſome moderate tolleration by faire dutiful meanes, then to hazard any ſuch forcible attempt. Adde hereunto, what a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant report vvas ſpread al the vvorld ouer, (which was hearkned vnto by the greateſt perſonages) that his Majeſty vvould take no exceptions againſt any man for his religion, but vvould ſuffer his ſubjects to liue quietly to their conſcience, and not ſo much as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barre any Catholike (that ſhould be found worthy) from any place of preferment vnder him.

                  <hi>And the heades of the Horſes, were as it were the heades of Lions, and from their mouthes proceeded fire, and ſmoke, and brimſtone:</hi> ſo fierce and fiery they be againſt poore innocent Catholikes, incenſing the King and ſtate to ſeeke their vtter ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion; and yet are they much more fatal to their owne followers: ¶<hi>For their tailes</hi> (as it is alſo in the ſaid text) <hi>be like to ſerpents, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing heades, and in theſe they hurt,</hi> poiſoning by their venimous do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and lende conuerſation, the ſoules of al men that beleeue and follow them. Thus much by occaſion of <hi>M. Abbots</hi> noble compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of Aſſes and Horſes.</p>
               <p>That vvhich he ſpeaketh of <hi>ſtrange long-footed wordes, inuented to ſtupefie the ſimple,</hi> is a riddle to me; our religion vſeth none ſuch. As for <hi>nouelty of wordes, bold faces, bigge lookes, brauadoes,</hi> and ſuch like, they are the proper badges of the new Goſpel, and <hi>M. Abbot</hi> doth himſelfe and his fellow Preachers great vvrong, to impart their peculiar titles to others that deſerue them not, nor like any vvhit of them.</p>
               <p>But let vs leaue theſe trifles, and come to his worthy obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and argument thereupon: It is, <hi>That M. Biſhop</hi> (forſooth) <hi>by law courſes only defended his Majeſties title to the crowne, by diuinity he could ſay nothing for it.</hi> Had not <hi>M. Abbots</hi> ſpiteful ſoare eies helped him to an odde inſight of my writings, he could neuer haue ſpied that there, which was not to be ſeene in them: for though I paſſed out of the limits of diuinity, into ſome points of law; yet diuinity was my ground, vvhich teacheth that vve muſt yeeld to euery one his right, and to lawful lineal ſucceſſours, the liuely-hoodes, landes, and poſſeſſions of their predeceſſours: his obſeruation then vvas falſe, that I could ſay nothing out of diuinity for his Majeſties title
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:14423:40"/> to the crowne. But he wil proue out of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> that moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Cardinal, (who indeede was my maſter, and maſter alſo vnto many my betters ſome ſix and twenty yeares agoe) that I could ſay nothing out of diuinity for his Majeſties title: <hi>For it is but by the law of man, that we haue this or that man to be our King, but by the law of God no man is to be made King, that doth not truly ſerue God; then the law of God being to be preferred before the law of man, it followeth, that whoſoeuer wil not truly ſerue God, is not to be made King.</hi> M. Abbot ſhould haue done wel to haue ſolued this argument (vvhich is not vnworthy the maker, and taken as he meant it inſoluble) and may happen to trouble many of his readers: but he loueth not this fight at the ſhort ſword, but to range a loofe off, and to defend his part vvith foule vvordes, rather then vvith any ſound reaſons. I vvil helpe him out of the briars this once and ſay, that in caſe of free e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of a King, that argument of Cardinal <hi>Bellarmines</hi> is moſt ſound; for no good Chriſtian ought to make choiſe of him for a King, or to yeeld their conſent to him, whom he knoweth vnlikely euer to ſerue Ieſus Chriſt the Soueraigne King of heauen &amp; earth: Marry, vvhen the Kingdome goeth not by free choiſe and electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but by ordinary ſucceſſion; then the ſubjects muſt accept of him whom it pleaſeth God to giue them. For our diuinity teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs, that God ſometimes giueth Kinges in his wrath, and not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſuch as wil ſerue him as they ought to doe, vvhich are (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their vndutifulneſſe to God) to be receiued and obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their ſubjects dutifully in al ciuil cauſes. And although God at the firſt left it to the free liberty of euery country, to make choiſe of vvhat kinde of ciuil gouernement they liked beſt (vvhereof it proceedeth, that it is by the law of man, that vve haue this or that man to be our King) yet when ſuch a ſucceſſion is once eſtabliſhed by the law of man, and confirmed by long cuſtome; then the law of God doth binde al men to the keeping of that juſt and good law of man. Thus much briefly to ſhew how I could very wel, by the rules of our diuinity defend his Majeſties title to the crowne, and to certifie them that are in greater jealouſie of our obedience, then they haue juſt cauſe; that vve take our ſelues bound aſwel by the lawes of God as of man, to obey his Majeſty, and dutifully to ſerue him in al temporal affaires: howbeit, we take the religion profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by his Majeſty, and his proceedings therein, not to be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:14423:41"/> to the good wil and pleaſure of God; and therefore doe dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pray vnto the diuine Majeſty, to ſend him grace to ſee and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it, and to giue vs perfect patience in the meane ſeaſon to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure vvhatſoeuer ſhal be laid vpon vs, for the conſtant profeſſion of his only true and ſincere religion. As for my skil either in this point, or in any other part of diuinity, I know it to be very meane in compariſon of thouſands among the Catholikes, and am very wel content that it be put to the proofe. Only I require an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent reader, and one that wil not take vaine wordes for good pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but waigh diligently our arguments together, and try out by ſeing the places, who citeth his teſtimony, both of holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures and ancient Fathers, more truly and pertinently.</p>

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:14423:43"/> vniforme and peacible eſtate of Chriſtendome, that ſuch ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent power ſhould rather reſt in the ſupreme Paſtor of Chriſts Church, then be left vnto the diſcretion of the Miniſters and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of euery country, according to the Proteſtants opinion and practiſe: It being (I ſay) granted, that the Biſhop of Rome, may in ſome caſe depoſe any temporal Magiſtrate; yet can it not there hence be gathered, that Kinges doe hold their Kingdomes of the Popes Holineſſe. For vvhen one King vvil not let his neighbour Prince liue in peace by him, but doth extremely waſt his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, kil his ſubjects, and make hauocke of his country; the Prince ſo moleſted (if he cannot otherwiſe haue remedy) may moſt law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully by force of armes, proceede euen to the depoſition of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious King: And yet the inuader did not hold his Kingdome of the other, any more then the other did depend vpon him, but was an abſolute King himſelfe as the other vvas, notwithſtanding by his intollerable outrages offered to his neighbour Prince, he made himſelfe puniſhable, and ſubject to the other, againſt whom he ſo grieuouſly treſpaſſed. In like manner, if a Prince by moſt extreme perſecution of Chriſts flocke, doe become ſubject to the correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the chiefe Paſtor thereof; yet thence it followeth not, that that Paſtor had power to diſpoſe of his Kingdome at his pleaſure, or that the King did hold his Diademe of him, either <hi>mediately</hi> or <hi>immediately;</hi> howbeit the Prince through his owne exorbitant and otherwiſe remedileſſe fault, doe juſtly fal into the Paſtors handes to be puniſhed.</p>
               <p>Here I doe by the way, moſt humbly craue of them to whom it doth appertaine, that it may without paſſion be duly conſidered: whether we Catholikes doe not his Majeſty more faithful ſeruice, and ſhew our ſelues much more careful of the quiet continuance of his glorious &amp; happy eſtate, when by al humble and faire meanes we doe labour moſt diligently to entreat his moſt excellent Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, to deale more gratiouſly and mildly with his poore Catholike ſubjects; then thoſe hot-ſpurre Miniſters, vvho labour tooth and naile, to caſt their louing Soueraigne into ſuch a brake of briars by incenſing his Highneſſe to hold ſo extreme a courſe againſt them. For if his Majeſty may be vvonne to follow the gentle and ſweet inclination of his owne nature, and to qualifie the rigour of the lawes againſt recuſants in ſuch temperate manner, that the ſaid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſant
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:14423:44"/> Catholikes may not be oppreſſed thereby; the Popes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe without al doubt, wil neuer goe about to depriue his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of his regal dignity, how forward ſoeuer he be otherwiſe to imbrace and aduance his owne religion: for not ſo much for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring the Proteſtants, as for extreame perſecution of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes (as the former example of neighbour Kinges doth ſhew) that moſt ſeuere cenſure of the ſupreme Paſtor of the Church is infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. Wherefore, vvhen it ſhal pleaſe his Highneſſe to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend gratiouſly vnto our humble and daily ſupplication, for more moderation and mercy; then ſhal his Majeſty vvithout al doubt (as euery man may eaſily perceiue) take away al jealouſie of thoſe buzzes, which ſeeme ſo greatly to diſquiet the whole ſtate.</p>

That doctrine vvhich he learned out of <hi>S.

To this vvhat ſaith <hi>M.

Doth he not deſerue a lawrel garland, for the vvorſhipful ranging of his battle? and is he not like to fight it out valiantly, that thus in the beginning flieth from the point of the queſtion? Proue (good Sir) that his Majeſty embraceth and maintaineth that religion, vvhich is ſpread ouer al the vvorld, and that hath continued euer ſince the Apoſtles time; and then you may juſtly ſay, that he vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth the Catholike religion, according to your owne explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of the ancient Fathers. But becauſe <hi>M. Abbot</hi> ſaw this to be impoſſible, he gaue it the ſlippe, and turneth himſelfe to proue the Roman religion not to be the Catholike, and perceiuing that alſo as hard to performe as the other, he ſhuffles from the religion and faith, of vvhich the queſtion vvas, vnto the Roman Church, that is, from the faith profeſſed at Rome, to the perſons inhabiting the citty of Rome, whom he wil proue not to be Catholikes, and the Roman Church not to be the Catholike Church. Doe you marke vvhat winding and turning, and what doubling this ſimple Miniſter is driuen vnto, ere he can come to make any ſhew of a ſilly argument?</p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:14423:46"/>
               <p>But let vs giue him leaue to vvander vvhither his fancy leadeth him, that vve may at length heare vvhat he would ſay: It is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, <hi>That the Church of Rome doth abſurdly cal her ſelfe the Catholike Church, and that Papiſts doe abſurdly take to themſelues the name of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, becauſe the Catholike Church is the vniuerſal Church, but the Church of Rome is a particular Church; therefore to ſay the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, is al one to ſay the vniuerſal particular Church:</hi> here is a vvel ſhapen argument, and worthy the maker; it conſiſts of al particular propoſitions, which euery ſmatterer in logicke knowes to be moſt vitious: beſides, not one of them is good, but al are ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtical and ful of deceit. Firſt, concerning the forme, if it were currant one might proue by it, that no one Church in the vvorld vvere Catholike; take (for example) the Engliſh congregation (vvhich they hold to be moſt Catholike) and apply <hi>M. Abbots</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to it thus: <hi>The Catholike Church is the vniuerſal Church, but the Church of England is a particular Church; wherefore to ſay the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Church is Catholike, is to ſay a particular Church is an vniuerſal.</hi> His firſt fault then is in the very forme of reaſoning, which alone is ſufficient to argue him to be a ſophiſter, and one that meaneth to beguile them that vvil truſt him: now to the particulars. His firſt propoſition <hi>(the Catholike Church is the vniuerſal Church)</hi> is both ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, becauſe the ſame thing is affirmed of himſelfe (for vniuerſal is no diſtinct thing, but the very interpretation of the vvord Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike,) and alſo captious, as hauing a double ſignification. For the Catholike Church doth ſignifie both the vvhole body of the Church, compacted of al the particular members vnited and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, in one; in which ſence no one particular Church can be called the Catholike Church, becauſe it is not the vvhole body ſpread ouer al the world; for it is <hi>totum integrale</hi> (to vſe the ſchoole tearmes) and not <hi>totum vniuerſale, quod dicitur de multis.</hi> Secondly, the Catholike Church doth alſo deſigne and note very properly, euery particular Church that embraceth the ſame true Chriſtian faith, which hath continued euer ſince Chriſts time, and beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in al countries, not only becauſe it is <hi>totum ſimilare</hi> (as <hi>M. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot</hi> ſpeaketh,) vvherefore euery true member of the Catholike Church may be called Catholike; but alſo becauſe each of the ſaid particular Churches hath the ſame Faith, the ſame Sacraments, and the ſame order of gouernement (al vvhich are as it vvere the ſoule
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:14423:46"/> and forme of the Catholike Church,) vvhich <hi>M. Abbot</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth: and further alſo confeſſeth out of <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were called Catholikes, <hi>Ex communicatione totius orbis,</hi>

                  <hi>By hauing communion of faith with the whole world.</hi> If then by his owne confeſſion, euery particular Church, yea euery particular Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, that embraceth and profeſſeth that faith which is dilated al the vvorld ouer, be truly called Catholike; how fondly then did he goe about to proue the Church of Rome not to be Catholike, and Papiſts not to be Catholikes, becauſe forſooth they were particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars? Yet that he may be thought not to doate outright, but rather to dreame, he addeth: <hi>That at least the Church of Rome, hath no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to aſſume to her ſelfe the prerogatiue of that title, becauſe that euery Church where the true faith is taught, is truly called Catholike, and no one more then another.</hi> I note firſt, that this man is as conſtant and ſtable, as the weather-cocke on the toppe of a ſteeple: before he proued ſtoutly (as you haue heard) that no particular Church could be called Catholike; now he wil haue euery particular Church, that receiueth the true faith, to be called Catholike.

               <p>Here comes in <hi>M. Abbots</hi> ſecond propoſition, <hi>(but the Church of Rome is a particular Church)</hi> in which is as great doubling and deceit as in the former: for albeit the Church of Rome, doe in rigour of ſpeech only, comprehend the Chriſtians dwelling in Rome; yet is it vſually taken by men of both parties, to ſignifie al Churches of vvhatſoeuer other Country, that doe agree vvith the Church of Rome in faith, and confeſſe the Paſtour thereof, to be the chiefe Paſtour vnder Chriſt of the whole Church. Like as in times paſt, the Roman Empire did ſignifie, not the territory of Rome alone, or dominion of Italy; but alſo any nation that vvas ſubject to the Roman Emperour: Euen ſo the whole Catholike Church, or any true member thereof, may be called the Roman Church, <hi>à parte principaliore;</hi> becauſe the Biſhop of Rome is the ſupreme head of their Church. Wherevpon, if you demand of a French Catholike of what Church he is, his anſwere wil be, that he is of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Roman Church; where he addeth Roman to diſtinguiſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from al Sectaries, vvho doe cal themſelues ſomtimes Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, (though moſt abſurdly) and to ſpecifie that he is ſuch a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, as doth wholy joine with the Roman Church in faith and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:14423:47"/> religion. Euen as the vvord Catholike was linked at firſt vvith Chriſtian, to diſtinguiſh a true Chriſtian beleeuer from an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike, according to that of <hi>Pacianus</hi> an ancient Authour;<note place="margin">Epiſtola. ad Simphorian.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſtian is my name, Catholike is my ſurname:</hi> ſo now a daies the Epitheton Roman is added vnto Catholike, to ſeparate thoſe Catholikes that joine with the Church of Rome in faith, from other ſectaries; who doe ſometimes cal themſelues alſo Catholikes, though very ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly, becauſe they be diuided in faith, from the greateſt part of the vniuerſal world. Out of the premiſes may be gathered, that the Roman Church may wel ſignifie any Church, that holdeth and maintaineth the ſame faith which the Roman doth: whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that <hi>M.

               </p>
               <p>Now to this his ſecond ſophiſtication, <hi>The Roman Church (by our rule) is the head, and al other Churches are members to it, but the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like comprehendeth al:</hi> ergo, <hi>to ſay the Roman Church is the Catholike, is to ſay the head is the whole body.</hi> Here is firſt a miſhapen argument, by vvhich one may proue or diſproue any thing; for example I wil proue by the like, that the Church of England is not Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, thus: <hi>The Church of England</hi> by their crooked rule, <hi>is a member of the Catholike Church; but the Catholike Church comprehendeth al: where fore to ſay the Engliſh Church is the Catholike Church, is to ſay, a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is the whole body.</hi> Beſides the counterfait faſhion of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there is a great fallacy in it: for to omit,<note place="margin">Fallacia ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentis.</note> that vve ſay not the Church of Rome, but the Biſhop of Rome to be the head of the Church, it is a foule fault in arguing (as al Logitians doe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand) when one thing is ſaid to be another by a metaphore, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute al the properties of the metaphore to the other thing. For example, Chriſt our Sauiour is metaphorically ſaid to be a Lion,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apocal.</hi> 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Vicit Leo de tribu Iuda:</hi> now if there hence any man would inferre, that a Lion hath foure legges, and is no reaſonable creature, <hi>ergo.</hi> Chriſt hath as many, or is not indued with reaſon; he might him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe therefore be wel taken for an vnreaſonable and blaſphemous creature: Euen ſo muſt <hi>M. Abbot</hi> be, vvho ſhifteth from that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the metaphore, <hi>bead,</hi> which was to purpoſe, vnto others that are cleane beſides the purpoſe. For as Chriſt vvas called a
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:14423:48"/> Lion, for his inuincible fortitude; ſo the Biſhop of Rome is called the head of the Church, for his authority to direct and gouerne the ſame: but to take any other propriety of either <hi>Lion</hi> or <hi>Head,</hi> when they be vſed metaphorically, and to argue out of that, is plainly to play the ſophiſter. Wherefore, to conclude this paſſage, <hi>M. Abbot</hi> hath greatly diſcouered his inſufficiency in arguing, by propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts that offend and be very vitious, both in matter and forme; and that ſo palpably, that if young Logitians ſhould ſtand vpon ſuch in the <hi>paruies,</hi> they would be hiſſed out of the ſchooles: it muſt needes be then an exceeding great ſhame, for a Diuine to vſe them, to deceiue good Chriſtian people in matter of ſaluation. And if after ſo great vaunts, of <hi>giuing ful ſatisfaction to the reader,</hi> and of <hi>ſtopping his aduerſaries mouth, that he ſhould not haue a word to reply,</hi> he be not aſhamed to put ſuch bables as theſe into print; he cannot chooſe but make himſelfe a mocking-ſtocke to the world: ſurely his writinges are more meete to ſtoppe muſtard-pots, (if I miſtake not much) then like to ſtoppe any meane ſchollers mouth.</p>

               <p>IN the former paſſage <hi>M. Abbot</hi> beſtowed an argument or two, raked out of the rotten <hi>rubbiſh of thoſe walles,</hi> (to vſe ſome of his owne wordes) vvhich vvere before broken downe by men of our ſide: Now he commeth to his owne freſh inuention, as I take it; for it is <hi>a fardle of ſuch beggarly baſe ſtuffe,</hi> and <hi>ſo ful of falſhood and childiſh follies,</hi> that any other man (I vveene) vvould not for very ſhame haue let it paſſe to the print. It conſiſteth in a compariſon and great reſemblance that is betweene the old doating Donatiſts, and the new preſumptuous Papiſts, if <hi>M. Abbot</hi> dreame not. <hi>The Donatiſts</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>held the Catholike Church to be at Cartenna, and the Papiſts doe hold it to be at Rome in Italy.</hi> Falſe on both ſides, becauſe we doe not hold it to be ſo at Rome, as they did at Cartenna: for we hold it to be ſo at Rome, as it is beſides alſo diſperſed al the world ouer; they, that it vvas wholy included vvithin the ſtraight boundes of Cartenna in Mauritania, and her confines: ſo that whoſoeuer was conuerted in any other country, muſt goe thither to be purged from their ſinnes, as <hi>S. Augustine</hi> teſtifieth in expreſſe tearmes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſtola.</hi> 48.</note> in the very place by <hi>M. Abbot</hi> alleaged. Falſe alſo in the principal point, that the Donatiſts held the Catholike Church to be at Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenna: for there dwelt only the Rogatiſts, who were (as <hi>S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> there ſpeaketh,) <hi>Breuiſsimum fruſtrum, de fruſtro maiore, A moſt ſmal gobbet or fragment, broken out of a greater peece;</hi> that is to ſay, a few ſchiſmatical fellowes fallen from the Donatiſts, as the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans are from the Proteſtants, or the Anabaptiſts from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries: ſo that although men of that ſect held the Catholike Church to be at Cartenna, yet the maine body of the Donatiſts maintained it not to be there at al, but held that congregation of Cartenna to be vvholy ſchiſmatical, and no true member of the Catholike Church. This firſt part then of the compariſon, is moſt vgly and monſtrouſly falſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is not vnlike: <hi>The Donatiſts would haue the Church to be called Catholike, not by reaſon of the communion and ſociety thereof through the whole world, but by reaſon of the perfection of doctrine and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, which they falſly challenged to themſelues; the ſame perfection the Church of Rome now arrogateth to her ſelfe.</hi> Here are many faults: the firſt is a groſſe lie in the chiefe branch; for the Donatiſts did not cal the Church Catholike, for the perfection of doctrine and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:14423:49"/> ſacraments: ſee <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> in both places, who expreſly deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,<note place="margin">Breui collat. cap. <hi>2.</hi> diei <hi>3.</hi> Epist. <hi>48.</hi>
                  </note> that it was for the fulneſſe of ſacraments, <hi>Ex plenitudine ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentorum;</hi> or for the obſeruation of al Gods commandements, <hi>Ex obſeruatione omnium diuinorum praeceptorum:</hi> of perfection of doctrine they ſaid not one word, they were more ſharpe-vvitted (as <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> obſerueth) then to goe about to proue <hi>vniuerſality by perfection,</hi> which is not vniuerſal. But ſeing wel that they could not defend their congregation to be Catholike, (that is vniuerſal) but by ſome kinde of vniuerſality; they defended it to be ſo called, for the vniuerſality &amp; fulneſſe of ſacraments and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements, that is: becauſe their Church retained al the ſacraments that the Catholikes did, and profeſſed to keepe al Gods commandements as fully as they. <hi>M. Abbots</hi> former fault then in this ſecond point of reſemblance (and that a foule one) is, in that he belieth the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts. And more palpably ſhould he haue belied the Roman Church, if he had juſtly brought in the reſemblance, to wit: if he had ſaid as due proportion required, that vve hold our Church to be Catholike as the Donatiſts did theirs, <hi>for the perfection of doctrine and ſacraments:</hi> vvhich is ſo manifeſtly vntrue, and ſo cleerely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the doctrine of al Catholike writers, that he (that was wont to bluſh at nothing) ſeemeth yet aſhamed to auouch it openly, and yet doth at laſt traile it in deceitfully. As for perfection of doctrine and ſacraments, though it be only in the Catholike Church; yet it is ſo farre wide from the ſignification and vſe of the vvord Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, that none (except ſuch wiſe men as <hi>M. Abbot</hi> is) doe thinke any thing to be Catholike, becauſe it is perfect.</p>
               <p>The third particle of the reſemblance is, <hi>That from Cartennathe the Donatists ordained Biſhops to other countries, euen to Rome it ſelfe. And from Rome by the Papiſts order, Biſhops be authoriſed to al other Churches.</hi> I am not ſo copious, as to afford to euery leaſing of <hi>M. Abbot</hi> a new phraſe; vvherefore the reader (I hope) wil beare with my rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, if I cal ſometimes a lie by the name of a lie. It is an vntrue tale, that the Donatiſts ordained Biſhops from Cartenna; for they could not abide that place, but eſteemed it to be Schiſmatical, as you haue heard before. He doth miſreport <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> vvho ſaith:<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> cont. Creſcon. c. <hi>37</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Quò ex Africa ordinare paucis vestris ſoletis Epiſcopum,</hi> you Donatiſts are wont to order and ſend a Biſhop thither to your few companions out of Africa, not from Cartenna in Mauritania.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:14423:49"/> Neither doth the Catholike Church appoint, that euery Biſhop ſhould goe to Rome to take holy orders, and from thence to be ſent to other Catholike countries; but in euery other region where be three Catholike Biſhops, they may be lawfully conſecrated: albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it for vnities ſake, and to preſerue due order, they be confirmed by the Biſhop of Rome, the ſupreme head vnder Chriſt of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church.</p>
               <p>The fourth point of the compariſon is moſt abſurd; for the Donatiſts were ſo farre from thinking them Catholikes, that kept communion with the Church of Cartenna, that they deteſted and abhorred their company as Schiſmatikes. Neither doe we cal any men Catholikes for keeping co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with the Church of Rome, if it be taken for that particular Church which is contained within the vvalles of Rome; but becauſe that communicating with that Church in faith and religion, they doe communicate with al other of the ſame faith, which are ſpread al the world ouer.</p>
               <p>Finally, the fift is as falſe as the fourth, and in the ſame ſort to be confuted. True it is, that the Donatiſts thought that none could be ſaued out of their congregation, which is almoſt a common po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of euery ſect and hereſie; but moſt ſure it is, that there is no ſaluation out of the true Church of Chriſt, no more then was out of the Arke of <hi>Noë</hi> in the general deluge: vvherefore, whoſoeuer doth not communicate with the Church of Rome, (vvhich is the chiefe member thereof) in ſociety of faith and ſacraments, is out of the ſtate of grace and ſaluation; according to that of <hi>S. Hierome</hi> to Pope Damaſus: <hi>I following no chiefe but Chriſt,</hi>

               <p>To conclude this paſſage, ſeing that <hi>M. Abbot</hi> went about, to proue the Church of Rome to be like that of the Donatiſts, by no one ſound argument but by meere fabling &amp; lying; he muſt looke (vnleſſe he repent)<note place="margin">

               <p>Secondly, <hi>M.

Neither was it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any peculiar and proper title of the people of God: for God had many good ſeruants, that were neuer called Iewes, as may be gathered by <hi>Iob</hi> the Huſite, <hi>Naaman</hi> the Sirian, the widow of<note place="margin">

                  <hi>But</hi> (and it pleaſe you) <hi>the Proteſtants haue the kernel of the name Catholike, and we but the ſhel.</hi> Why doe they then ſo bitterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueigh againſt it? vvhy are they not more willing to extol and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie that renowmed title, being of ſuch ancient Nobility? twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pound to a peny, that vvhat face ſoeuer he ſet on it, yet in his hart he maruailouſly feareth the contrary himſelfe. If that faith and religion only be Catholike &amp; vniuerſal (as he acknowledgeth) that hath euer beene, and is alſo ſpread ouer al the world, and ſhal continue to the worldes end; then ſurely their religion cannot be Catholike, euen by the vniforme confeſſion of themſelues: vvho generally acknowledge, that for nine hundred yeares together, the Papacy did ſo domineer al the world ouer, that not a man of their religion, vvas to be found in any corner of the vvorld, that durſt peepe out his head to contradict it. Could there be any Church of theirs then, when there was not one Paſtour and flocke of their religion (though neuer ſo ſmal) in any one country? and euen now

               <p>WE agree in this, that there is but <hi>one faith, one baptiſme, one ſpiritual foode, and one religion</hi> in the Catholike Church: but <hi>M. Abbot</hi> is fouly ouer-ſeene about the time, when the true Church beganne firſt to be called Catholike; which was not before Chriſts time but afterwardes, according to that alleaged out of <hi>Pacianus</hi> an ancient authour, who writeth of the name Catholike, ſaying: <hi>Christian is my name,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pacian. epiſt. ad Simphor. de nomine Catholico.</note> 
                  <hi>Catholike is my ſurname.</hi> For when among Chriſtians ſome beganne to teach falſe doctrine, and to draw o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers after them into ſects, they that remained ſound, &amp; did cleaue faſt vnto the whole body of the Church were intituled Catholikes, to diſtinguiſh them from Heretikes that did not joine vvith the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſal corps of Chriſtians, in faith and religion; which <hi>M. Abbot</hi> before did in plaine wordes confeſſe: ſee his text afore, vvhere he beginneth to argue of the word Catholike. And the reaſon is moſt perſpicuous, why the Iewes and their religion could not be called Catholike, though it vvere right and according to the wil of God for that time, becauſe Catholike ſignifieth <hi>that which is ſpread al the world ouer, and receiued of al nations;</hi> ſo was not the law of <hi>Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and the manner of ſeruing God therein preſcribed, but vvas peculiar vnto the children of Iſrael, and as it were confined with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the limits of one land and country: vvherefore it could not be called Catholike and vniuerſal.</p>
               <p>And <hi>M. Abbot</hi> was greatly deceiued, or elſe goeth about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue others, when for proofe of communicating with the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church, he recoileth back vnto the beginning of the vvorld. Why did he not rather ſhew, that their new Goſpel flouriſhed in al countries aſſoone as the Chriſtian faith vvas planted, and that it hath continued in al ages ſince the Apoſtles daies, vntil our time? that had beene to haue ſpoken directly to the purpoſe, which he ſeldome vſeth. But he ſaw that to be a worke to hard for <hi>Hercules,</hi> and therefore to delude his reader, and to lead him from the matter, he flieth vp to the old farne-daies of <hi>Abel, Noe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, &amp;c.</hi> as though they had reuealed vnto them, al thoſe particular points of faith which Chriſt taught his Apoſtles, and the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and manner of vvorſhipping God that we Chriſtians haue; which is flatly oppoſite to the doctrine of <hi>S.

Firſt he vſeth tergiuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, in leaping ſo farre backe from the point of the queſtion, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king communion with the Catholike Church, ſome thouſandes of yeares before there vvas any Church Catholike. Secondly, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouching the ancient founders of the firſt world, to haue beleeued clearely and particularly, al the articles of faith that vve beleeue; or elſe why doth he conclude, that the Roman faith is not Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, becauſe in that old and hoare-headed world, ſome branches of their faith were not ſprong vp and of ful growth? <hi>They did not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>worſhip Idols and Images, they did not pray to Saints,</hi> &amp;c. But (good Sir) did they beleeue that al their children vvere to be baptiſed? and that al perſons of riper yeares among them, were to receiue the holy Sacrament of Chriſtes body? yea, can <hi>M. Abbot</hi> demonſtrate, that they had perfect faith of the moſt holy and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Trinity, beleeuing diſtinctly in three perſons and one God? or that the redeemer of the world Chriſt <hi>Ieſus,</hi> was to be perfect God and perfect man, the nature of man in him ſubſiſting vvithout the proper perſon of man, in the ſecond perſon of the Trinity; which are the moſt high miſteries of our Chriſtian faith? I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that albeit thoſe ancient Patriarkes and Prophets, had not cleare and diſtinct knowledge of many articles vvhich vve are bound to beleeue; yet they beleeued ſome few of them in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and had a certaine confuſe and darke conceit by figures and tipes, of moſt of the reſt.</p>
               <p>Touching theſe very points, vvhereof <hi>M. Abbot</hi> would haue them vvholy ignorant (if his bare vvord without any manner of proof were ſo powerful) I affirme, that they held the moſt of them;

Firſt, no Catholike euer taught any man to worſhip Idols, let that then paſſe as a Proteſtant ſlander: but that Images are to be placed in Churches, the examples recorded in the old Teſtament, of hauing them both in their<note n="a" place="margin">

Seing then that the Proteſtants and al other ſectaries, doe not receiue the holy Scriptures, according vnto the moſt ancient and beſt learned Doctors expoſition; they may moſt juſtly be denied, to receiue the ſacred vvritten word of God at al, though they ſeeme neuer ſo much to approue al the Bookes, Verſes, and Letters of it; vvhich is plainly proued by <hi>S.

By vvhich diſcourſe it is euident, that I ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a moſt reaſonable requeſt vnto his Majeſty, that he would imbrace and countenance that religion, which al his Progenitors euen to the firſt Chriſtian among them, had liued and died in; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they vvere al Catholike, and not one of them can be named, vvho changed the religion of his fore-fathers: yet this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, <hi>Simmachus</hi> the Pagan vſing the like argument in ſhew, vvas not to be heard; the difference is, becauſe his fore-fathers for vvhoſe Idolatry he pleaded, had before forſaken the true and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere vvorſhip of the one liuing God, and therefore their children vvere not to continue in their Idolatry, but to returne vnto their former Anceſtors true piety. So vvere the Donatiſts children (of whom <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> cited by <hi>M.

                  <hi>That they would not accept of him for ſuch, without the Popes conſent who had their country in protection,</hi> as they then pleaded. And <hi>M. Abbots</hi> argument to the contrary, is moſt friuoulous: <hi>Alexander</hi> the King <hi>bade the Popes Legate to enter his country at his peril: ergo,</hi> he did not acknowledge the Popes authority. By the like ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument one might proue, that King <hi>Philippe</hi> and Queene <hi>Mary</hi> did not acknowledge the Popes authority; for they commanded a Legate of his, to ſtay at Calis, and to forbeare entrance into this Realme at his peril. The Popes Legates then, when they be ſent about affaires that doe ſeeme to the Prince and his Councel, preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious to the temporal ſtate, may be refuſed, without diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Popes ſupreme authority in cauſes Eccleſiaſtical. And the King of Scots had reaſon to refuſe that Cardinal Legate, whoſe ſpecial arrand was, to collect mony to maintaine the warres of the holy Land, vvhich was not to be ſpared in his country. Beſides, the very entertainement of ſuch a great State ſo accompanied, was

               <p>M. ABBOT concludeth this his clowdy and vvindy Section, with a ſtorme of railing; calling me in it <hi>dumbe Aſſe, diſsem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Hipocrite, baſe and beggarly Vaſſal.</hi> This laſt name he giueth me, becauſe I ſhewe my ſelfe ſorry, for that it vvas <hi>his Majeſties misfortune, to be bredde and brought vp in the Proteſtants religion:</hi> great cauſe you ſee vvas giuen him, to burſt out into ſo rude and bitter wordes. But to qualify this clowniſh tricke, he addeth the excuſe of a country <hi>Coridon,</hi> rather indeede accuſing then excuſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: for why did he <hi>forget that I was a Doctor in diuinity?</hi> or how did he forget it, that euen then ſo wel remembred it? He would not (forſooth) reſpect it here, but by a metaphyſical abſtraction conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me only as a <hi>ſubject:</hi> wherein he diſcouereth a double folly; for firſt who ſeeth not, that any man of neuer ſo great vvorſhip or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, may in like ſort be called a baſe vaſſal, if his dignity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree be excepted? Might not <hi>M. Abbot</hi> himſelfe (if one ſhould forget his calling and learning) be ſtiled in like manner a baſe beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly vaſſal? vvherefore, this figure of his may rather be tearmed ruſtical then rethorical. And had he not alſo forgotten himſelfe to be a Doctor in diuinity, yea a man of ordinary ciuility, he would not haue plaied the part of a furniſh and foule-mouthed butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wench, by falling into ſuch rude tearmes of ſcurrillity.</p>
               <p>His ſecond ouer-ſight is more queaſie and dangerous; for if I be a baſe vaſſal in that <hi>I am a ſubject,</hi> then is my Soueraignes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour called in queſtion: for none be baſe in that they are ſubjects, vnleſſe their Soueraignes be ſo meane and obſcure, that their roial eſtate cannot giue luſtre and dignity to thoſe that ſerue and obey them; for Soueraigne and Subjects be correlatiues, and the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of the one doth dignifie and ennoble the other. And to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:14423:63"/> from the ſubject, in that he is a ſubject, is to diſparage and to blemiſh greatly the Soueraignes Majeſty. <hi>M. Abbot</hi> then ſhewed himſelfe a jolly wiſe-man, and very acute, when he would remoue the cauſe of baſeneſſe, from my degree, and caſt it vpon the reſpect of my ſubjection, vvhich is common to me with al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Majeſties ſubjects, euen of the higheſt dignity, and moſt honourable calling. I doe not here forget, that there is incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable difference betweene one ſubject and another, both in degree and quality: yet am I bold to ſay, that he vvho debaſeth any one ſubject conſidered as a ſubject, (as <hi>M. Abbot</hi> ſpeaketh) doth joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offer great wrong and diſgrace, not only to al the reſt of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but euen to the Soueraigne himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Here I hope, the courteous Reader vvil giue me leaue, to ſay ſome-thing of the birth and degree of ſome Roman Prieſts, being by <hi>M. Abbot</hi> ſo often vpbraided with beggarly baſeneſſe: neither vvil I report aught elſe, then that vvhich by ſome honeſt men of great intelligence, is recorded for very true, to wit, that ſince theſe times of perſecution, more Gentlemen borne haue beene made Roman Prieſts, then are to be found in al the Engliſh Miniſtery, though for euery one Prieſt there be more then an hundreth Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. And touching <hi>M. Abbot</hi> himſelfe, I am credibly informed, that he is by birth but a meane Tanners Sonne of Gilford in Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey, and was at his firſt comming to Oxford, but a poore Scholler, gladde to ſweepe and dreſſe vp chambers, and to play the drudge for a ſlender pittance. Which I doe not vvrite as in contempt of ſuch baſe beginnings, from vvhich many haue proued profound Clarkes, and growne to great promotion; but only to admoniſh <hi>M. Abbot,</hi> out of the remembrance of his owne condition, not to carry himſelfe ſo contemptuouſly towardes others, vvho vvere borne his betters farre, and not brought vp ſo beggarly, but that they had as good maintainance in the Vniuerſity, as thoſe vvhoſe ſhoes he was gladde to wipe, and to ſweepe their chambers: other wiſe that graue ſentence of the wiſe Poët muſt needes be verified in him. <hi>Nil eſt aſperius humili cum ſurgit in altum.</hi>

I did not write a ſillable that ſounded to his Majeſties diſgrace, but
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:14423:64"/> did rather excuſe his failing in religion, laying the fault of it vpon them, who in his tender yeares (vvhen he was not able to judge) miſinſtructed him; ſignifying, that if it had beene his bleſſed hap, to haue eſcaped their ſeducing ſpeeches, til he had come to riper age, he would rather haue controled and corrected them, then haue giuen eare to their errours and follies. I vvillingly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a moſt rare readineſſe of wit in his Majeſty, and firmeneſſe of memory both to attaine to high litterature, and to deliuer it moſt eloquently: ſo much the more ſorry I am, that theſe goodly and faire gifts of nature, wanted ſuch ſupernatural aides and orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, as education in the Catholike Church, and among the beſt ſort of Catholikes, might and would moſt willingly haue afforded him; for then no doubt he would haue farre out-gone himſelf in al good litterature, and proued moſt ſingular. Let the conſiderate reader (to judge the better of our ſpirits) compare my ſpeeches to my So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne, vvith <hi>M.

               <p>As groſſe and palpable an vntruth is that vvhich followeth; <hi>That the Catholikes be not heauily perſecuted by the ſtate:</hi> whereas al their goodes and chattels be vvholy confiſcate, and two partes of their landes; their bodies at pleaſure ſubject to priſon, there to lie without baile or mainpriſe; their perſons daily in danger of death for receiuing or any vvay maintaining their Paſtours; to omit al other their oppreſſions which be almoſt innumerable: but belike, becauſe al Catholikes be not by moſt cruel death ſuddainly made away, this Miniſter of bloud, accounteth their perſecution light and eaſie. And vvhereas he ſo enlargeth the ſhort and ſmal perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their bretheren, I doe offer to joine with him in this iſſue: that more Catholike Prieſts, Religious men and others, haue beene tormented, murthered, and moſt deſpitefully ſlaine by men of their religion, within the compaſſe of two Realmes, France, and England, during the only time of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her raigne, then were of Proteſtants and men of al other Sects, for a thouſand yeares before in thoſe countries, yea &amp; take to them alſo al Spaine and Italy.

Any reaſonable man would rather judge, that the Church of Rome then came firſt to her moſt flouriſhing eſtate, when Idolatry and al kind of ſuperſtition was put to ſilence, and baniſhed out of her; vvhen the Chriſtian religion was publikly preached &amp; countenanced by the Emperours authority, which was not before the raigne of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> the great, our moſt glorious country-man: vvherefore <hi>M.

               <p>Now I come to the other points named by <hi>M. Abbot. There is nothing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in</hi> S.

But how chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth it, that you lept from <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> vnto one that was the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenth Pope after <hi>S. Peter?</hi> why did you ouer-skip al the reſt? Was there not one of the other twelue, that vvould afford you ſome peece of a darke broken ſentence, out of vvhich you might picke ſome colour of cauil againſt vs? If they vvould haue yeelded him any comfort, they ſhould not haue beene forgotten, as we may ſee by <hi>Anacletus,</hi> who is afterwardes haled in by the way, and yoked with another for want of ſome cleare ſentence of his owne.</p>
               <p>Wel let vs come to <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> the man of whom you haue made choiſe. Firſt, you relate ſuch a wiſe tale of ſo vvorthy a Biſhop,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:14423:77"/> ſo impertinent &amp; il hanging together, and ſo weakly verified, that no conſiderate perſon ſtanding vpright, can giue you any credit therein. To beginne with the Authors that report it, they be both profeſſed Proteſtants, and come more then a thouſand yeares to late for the relation of ſo auncient a matter, vnleſſe they had allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged other authentike Authours in confirmation of it. But <hi>Hollin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> reportes himſelfe to <hi>M. Fox,</hi> a crafty deceitful lying Miniſter of his owne time: <hi>Stow</hi> to ſome moth-eaten monument lying in the Guild hal. Now, what credit is to be giuen to thinges ſo ſillily confirmed, ſpecially vvhere there is farre greater probabilitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it? for <hi>Eleutherius</hi> was Biſhop of Rome, whoſe epiſtles and letters vvere regiſtred there, and moſt diligently preſerued in their treaſury, among other monuments of antiquity: where one only epiſtle of his to the prouince of France is to be found. And if he had vvritten another to a King of great Britany, no queſtion but it vvould haue beene as carefully preſerued there, as the other. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, what likelihood is there, that any old writing of or to <hi>Lucius</hi> King of great Britany, ſhould be preſerued in the citty of London, vvhen al the Britons vvere driuen thence by their enemies the Saxons, vvho vvere moſt like to make ſmal ſtore of ſuch letters, ſpecially which concerned the Chriſtian religion, to vvhich they were then enemies? And if they had reſerued any ſuch, ſhould not venerable <hi>Bede</hi> (our moſt learned and induſtrious country-man, vvho made moſt diligent enquiry after al ſuch, vvhen our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours were conuerted to the faith) haue heard ſome newes of this famous letter, vvho heard and writ as much of Pope <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> King <hi>Lucius,</hi> and the realmes conuerſion, as he could diſcouer, and finde any ground for, out of any part of antiquity? the like may be ſaid of al the reſt of our ancient Hiſtoriographers, whether En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh or Britons; among whom there is not one to be found, that made any mention of this vvorthy letter: how then is it poſſible that there ſhould be any ſuch? beſides, if you marke but the Kings demand and the Biſhops anſwere, both being perſons of great wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and grauity, ſuch ſimplicity and incongruity appeares, that any man of vnderſtanding wil take it to be ridiculous and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fait. <hi>The King</hi> (forſooth) <hi>writeth to the Pope, for a copy of the Roman conſtitutions, and Imperial lawes, for the gouernement of his realme:</hi> the Pope writeth backe <hi>ad correctionem Regis, to the correction and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:14423:77"/> of the King;</hi> vvhich is an anſwere as juſt as Germans lips: goodly ſtuffe ſurely, and fit to lie hidde in duſty corners. Thoſe vvordes <hi>(for the Roman conſtitutions to gouerne the Church)</hi> are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully ſhuffled in, beſides the purpoſe; as may appeare by the anſwere. And the King ſent before, and receiued by the Popes meſſengers, ful inſtruction of al points concerning the Chriſtian religion: wherefore he then wrote only for the Imperial lawes, to direct him how to gouerne his temporal eſtate. To vvhich the letter maketh the Biſhop to anſwere very childiſhly, that <hi>he had the old and new Teſtament,</hi> and willeth him to <hi>fiſh out thence the ciuil gouernement of his realme,</hi> vvhich neuer any Chriſtian King, either before or ſithens euer did. Adde finally, that the letter beareth date in thoſe authours cited by <hi>M. Abbot,</hi> 169. <hi>yeares after the paſsion of Chriſt,</hi> vvhich is at leaſt twiſe ſeauen yeares after the death of Pope <hi>Eleutherius.</hi> But al theſe impertinences and improbabilities being ſet aſide for the while, let it be graunted that the letter vvere true, and not fained, vvhat hold can the Proteſtants take on it to ſerue their purpoſe? ſurely very weake, and ſuch as may be moſt eaſily ſhaken out off their handes. The letter hath, <hi>That the nations and people of his Kingdome, were euen his children.</hi> Be it ſo, a good King is <hi>Parens Patriae, &amp; Paſtor populi; The Parent of his country and foster-father of his people:</hi> followeth it of this, that he is their chiefe head in ſpiritual cauſes? then were the Heathen Roman Emperors ſupreme head of the Church; for <hi>they were parents of their country,</hi> that is nouriſhers, defenders, and rulers of the common weale: this then wil help the Proteſtants nothing. Neither wil that which followeth in the letter, that they are <hi>Gods Vicars in his Kingdome, and ſhould gather his people vnto the law of Christ;</hi> for the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes doe allow Kinges to be <hi>Gods Vicars,</hi> not only in al the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affaires of their realmes, but alſo that they ſhould by counſel, countenance, example and authority, draw al their ſubjects to the true faith of Chriſt, <hi>and ſeeke to cal home, al them that are gone aſtray,</hi> and diuided from the Catholike Church, and <hi>to eſtabliſh peace and concord among them:</hi> and finally to <hi>gouerne them</hi> ſo happily vnited, in al ſuch thinges as appertaine vnto their Kingly vocation, and to the publike tranquillity of the common vveale. Now let the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different reader conſider, vvhether there be any one word in this ſuppoſed letter, that carrieth meate in mouth (as they ſay) to feede
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:14423:78"/> the Proteſtants faith: ſo that here is an ancient and reuerend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers letter cited to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>But <hi>M. Abbot</hi> ſaith, that <hi>now a-daies not the King, but the Pope is Gods Vicar, and his Vicar general for al Kingdomes.</hi> True it is, the Pope is Gods Vicar in al Chriſtian Kingdomes,<note place="margin">Sext. proem. in gloſſa.</note> (though there be not one vvord of any ſuch matter in the gloſſe cited by him) but that is in Eccleſiaſtical matters; vvhich nothing hindereth, but that the King is alſo Gods Vicar in temporal affaires: for he may be called a Vicar, that doth <hi>Vicem gerere alterius,</hi> that is another mans Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Lieutenant, or Subſtitute. One King may haue many Vicars, that is ſubſtitutes or deputies, to whom he committeth ſome prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal charge. King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight for example, hauing giuen him by the Parliament, ſupreme power in both Eccleſiaſtical and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral cauſes, had one Vicar for ſpiritual cauſes, and many other for the temporal: ſo God hath the Biſhop of Rome for Chriſtes Vicar general in cauſes of the Church, and Kinges in the adminiſtration of the common vveale. And the very Canon cited by <hi>M. Abbot,</hi> would haue taught him ſo much, if he had read it vvith a minde to learne the truth, rather then to ſucke out ſome matter of cauil out of it:<note place="margin">Diſtinct. <hi>96.</hi> Si Imperator.</note> for therein be theſe wordes; <hi>The Emperour hath the priuiledges of his power, which he obtained of God for the adminiſtration of publike lawes.</hi> Marke here the Pope acknowledgeth the Emperour, to be Gods Deputy and Vicar in the adminiſtration of the common lawes; vvhich in the Canon that goeth next before is confirmed: for there <hi>Gelaſius</hi> an ancient Pope ſpeaketh thus to <hi>Anaſtatius</hi> the Emperour;<note place="margin">Ibidem duo ſunt.</note> 
                  <hi>There be two thinges (ô Sacred Emperour) wherewith this world is principally gouerned, to wit, the holy authority of Biſhops, and the power of Princes.</hi> Theſe two then be both Gods Subſtitutes and Vicars; the one for ſpiritual cauſes, the other for temporal: where<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore <hi>M. Abbot</hi> reaſoneth very childiſhly, vvhen he goeth about to proue that we deny the King to be Gods Vicar, becauſe we teach the Pope to be Gods Vicar; for vve hold that they both be Gods Vicars, though in diſtinct and different matters. Neither laſtly can he take any aduantage of the word <hi>gouerne,</hi> if it be in that letter; for King <hi>Lucius</hi> demand was, for the Imperial lawes to gouerne the temporal ſtate of his realme: vvherefore it is euident that he ſpake there of temporal gouernement, and not of ſpiritual. Now becauſe the maine queſtion is, whether Kings haue authority ouer Biſhops
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:14423:78"/> in Eccleſiaſtical cauſes, or Biſhops ouer Kinges, let vs heare ſome two or three of <hi>S. Peter</hi> and <hi>S. Paules</hi> Succeſſours, <hi>M. Abbots</hi> owne vvitneſſes, deliuer their knowledge thereof. The firſt ſhal be the ſame learned and holy Pope <hi>Gelaſius</hi> laſt named: he affirmeth in the ſame Epiſtle vvhich vvas written to the Emperour himſelfe, that the authority of Biſhops in ſpiritual cauſes, doth extend it ſelfe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Kinges and Emperours, theſe be his vvordes.<note place="margin">Diſtinct. <hi>96.</hi> Duo ſunt.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou knowest (ô Emperour) thy ſelfe to depend on their judgements, and that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reduced to thy wil and pleaſure; therefore many Biſhops fortified with theſe ordinances, and with this authority ſupported, haue excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, ſome Kinges, others Emperours. And if a particular example be demanded of the perſons of Princes, bleſsed</hi> Innocentius <hi>the Pope did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate the Emperour</hi> Archadius, <hi>for conſenting vnto the depoſition of</hi> S. Iohn Chriſoſtome. <hi>And bleſſed</hi> S. Ambroſe, <hi>though a holy Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, yet not Biſhop of the vniuerſal Church, for a fault that to others did not ſeeme ſo grieuous, excommunicating</hi> Theodoſius <hi>the great, did ſhut him out of the Church, &amp;c.</hi> Is not this plaine enough, and directly to the purpoſe, that Biſhops haue power ouer Princes in Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal cauſes? and the authority of <hi>Gelaſius</hi> is of ſuch vvaight with <hi>M.

                  <hi>That the Church of Rome receiued by our Sauiour Chriſtes order, the primacy and preeminence of power ouer al Churches, and ouer the whole flocke of Chriſtian people:</hi> If then <hi>M.

               <p>I Cannot eaſily judge, whether this man were more fiercely bent to deceiue others, or more fooliſhly ſet to ſhame himſelfe vvith lying, that durſt aduenture vpon this Canon of the auncient and moſt learned Pope <hi>Iulius;</hi> for beſides that it hath nothing for the Proteſtants purpoſe, it doth in ſundry points notably confirme the Roman doctrine: thus beginneth the Canon. <hi>When euery crime and ſinne, is purged and blotted out by ſacrifices offered vnto God, what ſhal hereafter be giuen to God for the purgation of our ſinnes, when errour is committed in the oblation of the ſacrifice it ſelfe?</hi> (note how often he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peateth and recommendeth the diuine ſacrifice of the Maſſe.) <hi>For we haue heard of ſome men poſſeſsed with ſchiſmatical ambition, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to diuine order and the inſtitution of the Apoſtles, doe in the diuine ſacrifice, offer milke in ſteede of wine: others alſo for a complement of communion, doe giue the dipped Sacrament to the people, &amp;c.</hi> Then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing theſe opinions he ſaith: <hi>When the Maſter of truth did commend to his Diſciples the true ſacrifice of our ſaluation, he gaue to none of them milke,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>let therefore milke be no more offered when we ſacrifice.</hi> Then come in the broken vvordes of <hi>M. Abbot</hi> thus: <hi>But for that of the dipped Eucharist, which for a complement of communion they deliuer to the people, they haue not receiued any testimony brought out of the Goſpel, where our Lord commended to the Apostles his body and bloud; for there the bread is mentioned apart, and the commendation of the Chalice apart:</hi> where <hi>M. Abbot</hi> firſt left out <hi>the commending of Chriſts body and bloud
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:14423:81"/> to his Diſciples,</hi> becauſe thoſe vvordes vvould haue ſcalded his tongue. Secondly, this Canon hath nothing againſt that vvhich is now done by the Prieſt in the Maſſe: for the Prieſt doth not dippe any part of the Hoſt into the Chalice, to be afterwardes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out and giuen to the people, vvhich is that which Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> doth diſproue. Neither doe our Prieſts (to ſpeake properly) dippe any part of the Sacrament into the Chalice; for <hi>dipping in,</hi> impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth as much as the putting in and taking foorth againe, which we doe not: but only for a holy ſignification we doe put into the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, one litle par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> of the Hoſt, there to lie and not to be taken out againe, but to be receiued by the Prieſt together with the bloud; and therefore we cal it not the dipping in, but the mixture or min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling together of the body and bloud of Chriſt: wherefore <hi>M. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot</hi> erreth in the maine point of his reprehenſion. For Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> reproued only the giuing of the dipped Hoſt vnto the people, vvhich we doe not, nor hold it any way neceſſary; becauſe vve teach them, that the holy Hoſt of Chriſts body, containes in it ſelfe (being a liuing body) as wel Chriſtes bloud as his fleſh: now, vve doe only put a little peece of the ſacred Hoſt into the Chalice, there to be receiued with the pretious bloud, not of the people, but by the Prieſt alone. That this is no new deuiſe of the Church of Rome, may be wel gathered out of the ſame diſtinction, and in the very next leafe to that of Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> cited by <hi>M. Abbot,</hi> in the Canon <hi>Triforme,</hi>

I may not here forget, that in the very Canon of Pope <hi>Iulius,</hi> vvhich <hi>M.

                  <hi>In the oblations of Sacraments which are offered vnto our Lord at the ſolemne time of Maſſe, the paſsion of our Lord is to be blended; that his paſſion may be celebrated, whoſe body and bloud is made and conſecrated: ſo that ſuperſtitious opinions being baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, bread alone and wine mingled with water, be offered in the ſacrifice. For as we haue receiued from the Fathers, and very reaſon doth teach, in the cuppe of our Lord only water, or only wine ought not to be offered, but both of them mixed togither.</hi> And a little after: <hi>Crimes and ſinnes are blotted out, when theſe ſacrifices are offered; therefore the paſſion of our Lord, whereby we were redeemed is to be remembred: with ſuch ſacrifices our Lord is delighted, and ſhal be appeaſed, and wil pardon huge offences.

And to the former part of his ſentence <hi>(that in the Sacrament there is an Image or reſemblance of Chriſtes body)</hi> I anſwere, that vve Catholikes doe ſay as much in effect: for euery Sacrament is a viſible ſigne of an inuiſible and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing; and ſo Chriſts body vnder the forme of bread and wine,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:14423:83"/> is a reſemblance of his body parted from his bloud on the Croſſe: and the body of Chriſt vnder the formes of bread and vvine, as it is in the Sacrament, is a picture alſo, or reſemblance of the vnion of his miſtical body in faith and charity; euen as the bread is made of many graines of corne, and the vvine preſſed out of many clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of grapes. The later part of his ſentence may alſo haue a good meaning, and ſtand wel with our doctrine; for the nature of bread doth not wholy ceaſſe to be in the bleſſed Sacrament, becauſe the forme, ſauour, and taſt of bread, (which be natural qualities there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) doe ſtil remaine, though the whole inward ſubſtance be turned into the body of Chriſt; which that <hi>Gelaſius</hi> doth in the ſame place ſignifie, when he there ſaith: <hi>The ſame bread to be changed into the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ſubſtance,</hi> (that is, into the ſubſtance of Chriſt) <hi>by the operation of the holy Ghoſt, whereby the receiuers are made partakers of the diuine nature.</hi> And <hi>M.

               <p>NOW we come to <hi>Gelaſius</hi> the Pope indeede, and by his very phraſe related by <hi>M. Abbot,</hi> you may plainely perceiue, that he beleeued firmely, the ſacred body of Chriſt and his pretious bloud, to be really preſent in the bleſſed Sacrament: for thus he ſpeaketh. <hi>We haue found, that certaine men hauing receiued the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſacred body, doe abſtaine from the Chalice of the ſacred bloud.</hi> Neither doe his wordes fit <hi>M. Abbots</hi> turne, for the peoples recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vnder one kinde; for he ſpeaketh of Prieſts that doe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate both together, vvho therefore muſt receiue both together that he may be partaker of the ſacrifice which he himſelfe hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. For as it is ſaid in the Canon next before:<note place="margin">De conſecrat. diſt. <hi>2.</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſt.</note> 
                  <hi>Quale erit illud ſacrificium, cui nec ipſe ſacrificans particeps eſſe dignoſcitur? what kinde of ſacrifice is that, whereof he that ſacrificeth doth not participate? Where<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore, it is by al meanes to be obſerued, that how often the Priest doth ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice the body and bloud of our Lord</hi> IESVS <hi>Christ vpon the Altar; ſo often he exhibite himſelfe a partaker of the body &amp; bloud of our Lord Ieſus Christ.</hi> Theſe wordes (taken out of the Councel of Toledo) goe immediately before thoſe wordes which <hi>M. Abbot</hi> citeth, and doe euidently ſhew, that they are to be vnderſtood of the Prieſt only that conſecrateth the Sacrament; as alſo the very title would haue told <hi>M. Abbot,</hi> if he had beene diſpoſed to take them right: It is, that <hi>the Prieſt ought not to receiue the body of Christ without his bloud:</hi> So that here is not a vvord againſt the giuing the bleſſed body of Chriſt alone to the people.

               <p>HERE are many vvordes of a right reuerend Father cited to ſmal purpoſe; for the Church of Rome hath not yet changed one ſillable of the ſame her old language. Shee doth maintaine with <hi>S.

               <p>LET it firſt be conſidered, vvhat blunt and weake tooles the poore Proteſtants are forced to vſe, for want of better vvea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons to vvound ſimple ſoules withal. This (and it pleaſe you) is one of their mightieſt proofes for the Princes ſupremacy: the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours ſome times called general Councels:</hi> ergo, <hi>they were ſupreme go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors in cauſes Eccleſiaſtical:</hi> a doubty argument, as you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by the like. A Lord calleth for his tenants being carpenters to build him a houſe; <hi>ergo,</hi> that Lord is the chiefeſt carpenter in the country. If that Lord be not taken for ſupreme judge in the carpenters occupation, though he had ful power to aſſemble the carpenters together; vvhy ſhal the Emperour be eſteemed chiefe gouernour in Eccleſiaſtical cauſes, for that he hath authority to cal Eccleſiaſtical perſons together? Againe, al men know, that Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical perſons are in al temporal cauſes ſubject vnto temporal Princes, who therefore may command them to meete together, to compoſe contentions riſen about ſpiritual cauſes, vvhereby the temporal peace of his country is alſo much hindred; and this may be wel done, vvithout any pretence vnto ſoueraignity ouer them in ſpiritual matters: ſo that if it were graunted, that the Emperour had authority to cal general Councels, yet it vvould not follow thereof, that he were ſupreme head in Eccleſiaſtical cauſes; much leſſe can he be taken for ſupreme gouernour, becauſe the Popes gaue vnto the Emperours, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon and vſual wordes of courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, as <hi>M. Abbot</hi> afterward very childiſhly reaſoneth.</p>
               <p>But let vs come to the ground-worke of the queſtion: I affirme then, that though Emperour or King, for the temporal command he hath ouer his ſpiritual ſubjects, may cal them together vvhen there is juſt cauſe; yet the ſoueraigne ſummoning of al Biſhops &amp; Eccleſiaſtical perſons to a general Councel, doth not properly or principally belong to the Emperours, but vnto the chiefe Paſtour among them: for very reaſon teacheth euery judicious man, &amp; by induction through al ſocieties it is moſt manifeſt, that the chiefeſt
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:14423:87"/> member of any corporation or aſſotiation, hath by inſtinct of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that priuiledge of calling together the reſt of that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany and corporation; wherefore the lay Magiſtrate, that is no proper mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Eccleſiaſtical congregation, cannot in natural reaſon and equity, haue that power of aſſembling the Clergy together. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, no Chriſtian Emperor had euer yet ſo much as temporal do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion ouer al Chriſtendome: thoſe Chriſtians then that were not his ſubjects at al, could not be called together by his authority. That their Empire vvhen it was at the largeſt, vvas not ſo large as the bounds and limits of Chriſtian religion, <hi>S.

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:14423:88"/> to delegate ouer the Churches of the Eaſt (vvhere was moſt doubt of his authority) ſuch power vnto others: Can it be doubted, but that he vvas moſt certainly perſwaded, that the Biſhop of Rome hath and alwaies had ſupreme command, in Eccleſiaſtical cauſes al the world ouer? And that you may ſee that <hi>S.

                  </note> the place by him aſſigned for that general Councel. The reaſon that moued <hi>S.

Firſt, becauſe (as I before ſignified) the Biſhops to be aſſembled, vvere for the moſt part the Emperours ſubjects in temporal affaires, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were not vvithout his priuity, to be called ſo farre from their reſidences. And for this cauſe, the Kinges of euery country being aduertiſed by the Popes Holineſſe, of a general Councel, doe to this day (as it appeared in the laſt general Councel of Trent) ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon the Biſhops of their Realmes to the ſaid general Councel, and command them to make choiſe of ſome to ſend thither; vvhich doth nothing derogate to the Popes general ſummoning. Beſides, the Heretikes of thoſe times vvould not obey the Pope, nor their lawful Paſtours command, no more then theſe of our time: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Emperours power vvhich they dreadded, and ſtoode in more awe off, vvas to be joined with the Popes authority; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had good cauſe to requeſt it.</p>
               <p>Yet that the vnderſtanding reader may perceiue, how <hi>S.

I requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red indeede of your most gratious clemency, that the Synode which you thought neceſſary to be aſſembled, as we alſo required, for the reſtoring of vnity in the Eaſt Church, might be for a time deferred; that the mindes of men being more ſettled, thoſe Biſhops which for feare of enemies are ſtaied at home, might alſo meete: but for that you doe zealouſly preferre Gods

               <p>Did you marke before in thoſe few wordes, how he <hi>eſteemed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolike tradition, and the definitions of Councels, and of the See Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, to be the firme foundation of the Church of Christ;</hi> which alone is ſufficient to batter and beate flat to the earth, that chiefe fortreſſe of the Proteſtants, of the al-ſufficiency of the vvritten word: then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing deliuered the true faith of the bleſſed Trinity, he annexeth theſe wordes. <hi>This is the Apoſtolical and Euangelical Tradition, which the Apoſtolike Church of God (the Mother of your moſt happy Empire) doth hold: this is the pure confeſsion of piety: this is the rule of the true faith, holden aſwel in prosperity as in aduerſity by the Apoſtolike Church of Chriſt; which is proued by Gods grace neuer to haue ſtraied from the path of Apoſtolical Tradition, nor euer was corrupted with Heretical no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelties, becauſe it was ſaid to Peter:</hi> I haue praied for thee that thy faith faile not; and thou being conuerted, confirme thy brethren. <hi>Here our Lord promiſed, that the faith of</hi> Peter <hi>ſhould not faile, and willed him to confirme his brethren: which the Biſhops my predeceſſours, as is wel knowne to al men, haue alwaies done confidently; and I though much inferiour to them, yet for the perſon that by Gods goodneſſe I ſuſtaine, doe deſire to follow them at the heeles:</hi> this out of Pope <hi>Agatho</hi> by the way, in fauour of our cauſe, becauſe <hi>M.

               <p>Now that which followeth in him out of <hi>Tertullian: That the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror is honoured according to the ancient doctrine of the Church, as next vnto God, &amp; inferiour vnto God only.</hi> If the good man would haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought himſelfe a little, vvhat kinde of men the Emperours were in <hi>Tertullians</hi> time, and before; he vvould not (I thinke) for very ſhame, haue once offered to proue thoſe Emperours ſupreme au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in cauſes Eccleſiaſtical: for they were al of them Heathen Idolaters, and profeſſed enemies to the Chriſtian religion. If then they vvere next vnder God ſupreme gouernours of Eccleſiaſtical cauſes, it would follow thereof (ſee the good effect of <hi>M. Abbots</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument) that the Chriſtian religion vvas to be forſaken of al men, and Idolatry to haue beene imbraced: for that was theſe Emperors ſupreme judgement in ſpiritual matters.

               <p>Now to thoſe wordes which he propoſeth as very odious: <hi>That how much the Moone is leſſe then the Sunne, ſo much is the Emperour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to the Pope.</hi> They be not preciſely the wordes of the Canon, but theſe: <hi>That how much difference there is betweene the Sunne and the Moone, ſo much is there betweene Biſhops and Kinges.</hi> The ſence he doth not much alter, but only ſets it out more diſdainfully; vve allow of the ſence being rightly taken, to wit, that the authority of Biſhops, is properly to be compared to the brightneſſe of the Sunne, becauſe it is wholy conuerſant in ſpiritual cauſes, vvhich depend vpon the brightneſſe and light of faith, and doe formally appertaine to the heauenly Kingdome of the Sunne <hi>Christ Ieſus:</hi> Now who ſees not, that the Emperours power being properly to gouerne the temporal ſtate, by the light of natural reaſon (which is very dimme and obſcure, if it be conferred vnto the light of grace) may aptly be reſembled to the Moone light; the light of heauenly affaires, as farre paſſing in cleareneſſe the light of vvorldly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, as doth the brightneſſe of the Sunne at noone daies, paſſe

Now if vve would ſearch higher towards the moſt pure Antiquity, we ſhal finde farre greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons betweene the ſpiritual power of Biſhops, and the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of Emperours: I vvil for a taſt, cite only the ſentences of two moſt authentike Doctors. <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> an ancient and moſt graue Father, ſaith: <hi>Bretheren, the honour and ſublimity of a Biſhop,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ambroſ. initio ſui Paſtor. ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatur diſt. <hi>96.</hi> cap. Si duo. Greg. Oratio. ad populum perturb.</note> 
                  <hi>cannot be equalled with any compariſon. The Majeſty of Kinges, and Diademes of Princes, if they be compared to it, are farre more inferiour, then if the met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of leade ſhould be compered with gold.</hi> And <hi>S. Gregory Nazianzene</hi> maketh no leſſe difference betweene them two, then there is <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the ſoule &amp; the body,</hi> the ſpiritual power of Biſhops, as much in his judgement, excelling that of Princes, as the ſoule in dignity doth ſurmount the body: ſo that the Popes compariſon (alleaged by <hi>M. Abbot</hi>) is very temperate, in reſpect of theſe of the auncient Fathers, vvhich notwithſtanding vvere made vpon great judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The lies and toies that enſue in <hi>M. Abbots</hi> text, are not worth the anſwering. Firſt,<note place="margin">Catal.

Secondly, if any Emperour or King, out of his owne profound humility, or aboundance of zeale towardes his ſpiritual Paſtour, would of himſelfe doe any ſuch lowly ſeruice, as to <hi>hold the baſin, &amp;c.</hi> that is not to be imputed to him that ſuffereth it againſt his wil, as a marke of pride. To ſay that any Emperour or King, contrary to his wil was enforced to doe it, is a very fitten, as euery child may perceiue: for who either would or could force ſo mighty a Monarke, to ſo baſe a ſeruice, vnleſſe he himſelfe deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it? As for that <hi>oath of fidelity,</hi> vvhich the Emperour maketh to the Popes Holineſſe, I finde it not either in the 69. or 96. Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but in the 63 and it is only: that <hi>the Emperour ſhal not doe any harme, vnto the Popes temporal ſtate in Italy; and if he chance to come to Rome, that be then ſhal carry to him and the Church of Rome, ſuch respect as is meete.</hi> I vvould gladly be informed what alleageance may be picked out of this, and whether it be not expedient, (the Emperor being to be confirmed by the Pope) that he ſhould take ſuch an oath of him for his owne ſafety. The next text cited out of the Clementine, <hi>De appellatione,</hi> is a meere fiction:<note place="margin">Can. Paſtor.</note> for there is no ſuch chapter nor matter.

And let the Proteſtants paint it out al they can, a monſtrous thing it muſt needes appeare vnto al men of vpright judgement, and the Chriſtian world to be there turned topſy and turuy, <hi>where children ſhal take vpon them to rule their fathers, and ſchollers to teach their maſters.</hi> Thus much in anſwere vnto al that is objected out of <hi>S.

               <p>I hauing in my Epiſtle to his Majeſty ſaid, that he being at the Councel of Nice, would not ſit downe before the Biſhops beckned to him ſo to doe; and that he there did profeſſe, that it did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to him to judge of Biſhops, but vvas rather to be judged of them: <hi>M.

                  <hi>That the Emperour</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine <hi>durst not judge Biſhops though they themſelues wiſhed and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it.</hi> By the record therefore, of theſe moſt ancient, holy, and learned Prelates, neither <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, nor any other Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Emperour, was or could be judge in Eccleſiaſtical affaires o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Biſhops: vvhence it followeth moſt perſpicuouſly, that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantines</hi> owne wordes (confeſſing that it did not belong to him to judge Biſhops and their cauſes) are to be taken plainly as they ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie, and vvere not ſpoken by him (as <hi>M.

His firſt conjecture is, that though <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ſate not downe vntil the Biſhops beckned on him; yet he <hi>ſate in the higheſt place, on a ſeate of gold:</hi> vvhich if it were true,<note place="margin">Euſeb. de vita Conſtant. lib. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>10.</hi>
                  </note> as it is falſe, yet vvould it not proue <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to be the Preſident or Iudge of that aſſembly. For as <hi>Theodoret</hi> doth expreſly note, the place that he there had, vvas by permiſſion of the Biſhops at his ſute, and not properly belonging to him; theſe be his vvordes. <hi>Then the Emperour ſate downe,</hi>

Secondly, the Tripartite Hyſtorie doth manifeſtly declare, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ſate below the Biſhops:<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> Hyſt. Tripar. ca. <hi>5.</hi>

                  </note> And the wordes of <hi>Theodoret</hi> may alſo import as much: <hi>He ſate in a little ſeate, placed in the middeſt amongst them.</hi> And falſly or craftily, doth <hi>M.

But in the vppermoſt part of the Hal, a little chaire vvas placed for him, beneath the benches whereon the Preſidents of the Councel, and chiefeſt Patriarks did ſit: for ſo the other Eccleſiaſtical hiſtoriographers doe intimate.

Finally, the Emperour <hi>Bazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> deliuereth in the end of the eight general Councel, <hi>That</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine <hi>ſubſcribed the Councel, after al the Biſhops there aſſembled;</hi> vvhereas the Preſident and chiefe Iudge of the Councel, ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth in the firſt place.

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:14423:95"/> there propoſed: what vpright weigher of ſuch ſerious affaires can doubt, but that he was nothing leſſe then the chiefe Preſident and moderator there? True it is, that he out of his owne zeale &amp; graue vviſdome, did firſt attentiuely heare them, then ſometimes ſpake himſelf ſpecially to appeaſe the contentious wranglings of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Heretikes, and their fauourites of whom many were there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and the ouer forward and feruent zeale of ſome Catholikes: but this argueth no ſuperinte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dency or preſidency, but only Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian diſcretion and charity, to helpe forward an orderly exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and peacible determination of thoſe controuerſies. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith M.

And moſt like that they who ſo did, vvere vnruly Arrians or very vndiſcreete Catholikes: whereof who but an indiſcreet perſon or wrangling Heretike can take hold? Againe, vvhere <hi>Euſebius</hi> reporteth, that <hi>Conſtantine did as an arbitratour, ſeeke to make attonement betweene the Aegiptian Prelates,</hi> he addeth: that <hi>he did it with very great respect: Eos vt Patres, imò vt Dei Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas omnino honorifice reuerens; Reuerencing them very honourably as his Fathers, yea more, as the Prophets of God;</hi> not domineering ouer them as his inferiours: and <hi>preſcribed to them ſome ſuch thing, as did belong to the good of Gods Church,</hi> to wit, that they would leaue off their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention, and quietly obey vnto the decrees of the Nicene Councel.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>M. Abbot</hi> perceiuing very wel that he had hitherto but trifled, and ſpoken little to the purpoſe, he addeth: <hi>And that</hi> M.

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:14423:97"/> he knew &amp; did profeſſe, that it did not appertaine to him to judge: Yet finally, to ſtoppe the impudent mouthes of the Donatiſts, and to leaue them cleane vvithout al excuſe of their obſtinate ſtubbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deſcended to heare the cauſe himſelfe after the Biſhops; not that he thought himſelfe to haue any right ſo to doe, but mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to craue pardon of the ſacred Biſhops, for that he had inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medled in their matters, further then he ought to haue done.

                  </note> as <hi>M. Abbot</hi> now doth. <hi>Not ſo</hi> (ſaith <hi>S. Augustine) your cauſe hath bad a competent and ſufficient trial before many Biſhops, neither are you to be dealt withal any further, concerning the right of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination and trial; it only now remaineth, that you quietly accept of the ſentence pronounced of this cauſe:</hi> ſo that in <hi>S. Auguſtines</hi> judgement, the competent, lawful, and ordinary trial of Eccleſiaſtical cauſes, is before Biſhops, from which none but Heretikes doe appeale and flie. And touching the Donatiſts, whoſe example the other Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes alleaged,<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> this holy Father ſaith: <hi>They were ſo violent, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:14423:98"/> ſo ſtronge, that we were forced to follow them appealing to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: for they ranged and raged with ſuch fury, almoſt al Afrike ouer, that they would not ſuffer the Catholikes to preach, or to liue in peace by them; but by fire, ſword, and forrage, put the whole country in garboile and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion: wherefore the Biſhops were compelled for the ſuppreſsing their fury, and for to bring them to reaſon, to conferre with them before the lay Magiſtrate.</hi> Thus much of <hi>M. Abbots</hi> former inſtance of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts. Now to his other borrowed from the Arrians, who were aſſembled in a very wicked conuenticle at Tyre, to condemne the moſt innocent Prelate and Saint of God, <hi>Athanaſius;</hi> vvho beſides alſo was Patriarke of Alexandria, the chiefe ſeate of al the Eaſt, and therefore rather to judge ouer them, then to be judged of them: yet thoſe moſt malitious Arrians, to wreake their teene on him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented moſt ſtrange crimes of Rape, Murder, and Treaſon againſt the man of God, and had falſe vvitneſſes in readineſſe, to teſtifie vvhat they would deſire; yet were they ſo prudently encountred, and al their moſt wicked plots ſo plainly diſcouered, by the grace of God, and <hi>S. Athanaſius</hi> moſt vigilant induſtry, that they fel at laſt to conſpire his death by open violence. Al which being rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Emperour, he wrote a moſt ſharpe letter to thoſe bloudy conſpiratours, and willed them to come to the place, where he then made his abode, there in his preſence and hearing, to ſhew whither that which they had done there, were equal and juſt. He doth not ſay (as <hi>M. Abbot</hi> falſly reporteth) <hi>that the Biſhops were to giue him account of that they had done;</hi> but according to <hi>Athanaſius</hi> requeſt,<note place="margin">Socrat. lib. <hi>1.</hi> Hiſtor. c. <hi>22.</hi>
                  </note> vvhich was as it is ſet downe in the ſame letter, <hi>Vt eo accederetis, quo nobis praeſentibus, de injuria qua paſſus fuerit, (neceſsitate coactus) poſſet expoſtulare: That the Councel might be remoued to the Emperours Court, to the intent that</hi> Athanaſius <hi>(compelled by neceſsity) might expoſtulate and complaine in the Emperours preſence, of the injury done vnto him.</hi> Firſt note, that the holy Patriarke compelled by neceſſity of the Arrians fury, repaired to the Emperour. Secondly, that he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the matter might be heard, though in the Emperours preſence; yet by the Biſhops aſſembled in that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenticle: for he had reaſon to thinke, that they vvould not for very ſhame ſuffer the matter to be ſo partially and furiouſly handled, if that good Emperour were preſent and did but looke on them. Thirdly note, that there vvas no matter of faith in queſtion, but capital crimes and temporal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:14423:99"/> of the ſtate objected againſt <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> wherein the lay Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate hath more ſpecial intereſt. Briefly, here is no mention of the Emperours judging ouer Biſhops, but only of a ſending for them to come to him, &amp; to handle ſo waighty a matter before him, which any temporal Prince (for aught I ſee) may demand and alſo command, of Biſhops that be his owne ſubjects, vvhen cauſe of the temporal ſtate is touched.</p>
               <p>Out of the premiſes it followeth moſt euidently, that <hi>M. Abbot</hi> hath not one plaine word, to proue the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to be ſupreme judge in Eccleſiaſtical cauſes, but relieth vvholy either vpon the example of reprobate Heretikes, or vpon his owne infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and enforcements, drawne out of ſome darke ſentences, ſo ſhameleſly alleaged for the moſt part, that they are cleane contrary to the plaine teſtimony of his owne authors in the very ſame place; vvhereas we haue that moſt renowmed Emperours owne formal and expreſſe wordes, profeſſing himſelfe <hi>to haue no power to judge ouer Biſhops and Church affaires;</hi> and that alſo fortified by the ſound record of moſt graue, holy, and learned Fathers, who liued ſome in his owne daies, and ſome very neare thereunto. Let then any man judge (if he be not too too partial) vvhether I gaue his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty wrong to vnderſtand, when I enformed him, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great (that glorious ornament of our country) vvould not take vpon him to be ſupreme gouernour in cauſes Eccleſiaſtical: Or vvhether <hi>M. Abbot,</hi> doe not goe about exceedingly to abuſe his moſt excellent Majeſty, that with ſuch bables, foule ſhifts, and manifeſt lies, would perſwade him the contrary. Hitherto of the Emperours authority in calling of Councels, and ouer Biſhops, ſo farre forth, as <hi>M. Abbots</hi> objections out of <hi>S. Leo</hi> miniſtred juſt cauſe.</p>
               <p>Now ere I paſſe vnto the next Succeſſor of <hi>S. Peter</hi> and <hi>S. Paul.</hi> which <hi>M. Abbot</hi> would force to ſpeake in defence of their new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, I muſt according to cuſtome ſhew in part, what this Authour of his <hi>S. Leo,</hi> doth teach in fauour of the Catholike cauſe; that the indifferent reader may judge, whether he were rather a Proteſtant or a Papiſt, as they tearme vs. And becauſe <hi>S. Leo</hi> is both ancient (for he liued about 1200. yeares paſt) and was alſo a moſt holy man, by whom God did miraculouſly vvorke, euen in his life time: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, for that he was very skilful both in the holy Scriptures, and al learned Antiquity Greeke and Latin, as may be ſeene by his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:14423:99"/> and Epiſtles, ſpecially by the laſt Epiſtle written for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Emperour called alſo <hi>Leo;</hi> where he citeth <hi>S. Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary, S. Ambroſe, S. Augustine,</hi> Latines; <hi>S. Athanaſius, Theophilus, Cyrillus</hi> Patriarkes of Alexandria, <hi>Gregory Nazianzene, S. Baſil,</hi> and <hi>S. Iohn Chryſoſtome,</hi> Greeke Doctors: And finally, for that his workes be without al exception, euen by the conſent of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, yea of ſuch credit vvith them, that they are gladde vvhen they can ſnatch a broken ſentence out of him, in fauour of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; I wil therefore ſomewhat more largely cite his ſentences, in defence of the preſent Roman religion, becauſe they cannot chooſe but be of great value with al euen-minded men. And the better to ſatisfie <hi>M. Abbots</hi> demandes, I wil frame the order of <hi>S.

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:14423:103"/> What if ſome Popes or other Clergy-men, haue beene too forward to ſatisfie the greedy couetouſneſſe of their carnal friends, that is their owne fault, contrary to the prouident order and law of the Church? and if the corrupt nature of man, be ſo inclinable to fauor them that be next in bloud to them, was it not right vviſely ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by our Church, that Clergy-men ſhould haue no wiues and children? for that men naturally doe loue them moſt dearely, and vſe al meanes to prouide for them. But how careleſly herein doe the Proteſtants carry themſelues, vvho doe encourage, and as it were puſh their Clergy-men forward, to haue wiues and children? vvho being thereby clogged with the cares of this world, bidde adieu to al courteous and plentiful hoſpitality, and leaue the poore to ſhift as they can for themſelues: for they haue more then enough to doe, to prouide for their owne wiues and children.

               <p>The moſt ſweet and religious father <hi>S. Bernard,</hi> is haled into this ranke of <hi>S.

How may we know that? Is it becauſe that godly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout man, did in al points imbrace and follow the ancient Roman faith?<note place="margin">L. <hi>2.</hi> de Conſ. ad Euge.

Monaſteries. Briefly, there is no branche of the preſent Roman faith, which may not be confirmed out of his godly and learned workes: Wherefore, if <hi>S. Bernard</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed vvholy with the doctrine of the ancient Church of Rome; ſo doth the Church of Rome that now is. But if <hi>M. Abbot</hi> wil ſay, that in this point of merits only, he jumpeth vvith the auncient Church, though in none of the reſt; ſhould he not rather haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it to be ſo, then to haue taken it as granted? Yes verily, vnleſſe he vvould be eſteemed for ſuch a trifler, as ordinarily doth <hi>petere principium,</hi> begge that which he ſhould principally proue. To the purpoſe then I ſay, that neither the ancient Church of Rome doth deny the merits of good workes, as may be ſeene in that queſtion, nor yet <hi>S. Bernard:</hi> for when he ſaith, <hi>That our merits doe not in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice deſerue heauen,</hi> he vnderſtandeth that, of our merits taken by themſelues, without Gods promiſe and appointment of heauen for the reward of them; the which ſecluded &amp; excepted, God ſhould not doe any body wrong, if he gaue not heauen for the ſame: but Gods ordinance &amp; promiſe preſuppoſed, and the grace of Chriſt, by which the merit is wrought, then it doth euen in <hi>S. Bernards</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, of right deſerue heauen, and God ſhould doe wrong not to repay it with heauen. And this in effect doth <hi>S. Bernard</hi> himſelfe
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:14423:105"/> teach, in the ſecond place cited by <hi>M. Abbot,</hi> vvhere he ſaith: <hi>That it is juſt that God pay that which be oweth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Lib. Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trio, In fine.</note> 
                  <hi>but he oweth that which be promiſed; the promiſe was indeede of mercy, but now to be performed of juſtice: which juſtice, though it be alſo principally Gods, becauſe it proceedes from his grace; yet it hath pleaſed God, to haue vs to be partners of that his justice, that he might make vs merit ours of his crowne. In eo enim ſibi juſtitiae conſortem, &amp; coronae ſtatuit promeritorem, cum operum quibus erat illa repromiſſa corona, habere dignatus eſt coadjutorem: For therein did God appoint man to be copartner of his juſtice, and meritour of the crowne, when be vouchſafed to haue him coadjutour of thoſe workes, vnto which that crowne</hi> (of glory) <hi>was againe and againe promiſed.</hi> So that God is the Authour of merits, both by giuing man grace to doe them, and by ordaining them to ſuch a reward: <hi>Otherwiſe</hi> (ſaith S. Bernard) <hi>thoſe which we cal merits, might be more properly called the way to the Kingdome, not the cauſe of raigning.</hi> Obſerue that he ſaith, vnleſſe you take <hi>them otherwiſe</hi> then he had before ſpoken of them. But we muſt beare with <hi>M. Abbot,</hi> for ſnatching here and there a ſentence out of the Fathers ſo abruptly; otherwiſe he could make no ſhew for his part out of them, becauſe they vvere ſo ful and wholy Roman Catholikes.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the miſconſtruing of <hi>S. Gregories</hi> wordes, and the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting of <hi>S. Bernards, M. Abbot</hi> falſifieth both the Councel of Trent, and the Annotations of the Rhemes Teſtament: for the Councel of Trent hath not ſimply, that <hi>good workes doe fully ſatisfie the law of God;</hi> but with this qualification, <hi>Pro huius vitae ſtatu: As farre forth as the ſtate of this life doth permit.</hi> And whereas <hi>M. Abbot</hi> fableth, that in thoſe Annotations <hi>the juſtice of God is charged, not in respect of his owne promiſe, but in reſpect of the merit and deſert of the workes;</hi> it is a palpable vntruth, as euery man may ſee, that wil but turne to the place: for there are theſe expreſſe wordes.<note place="margin">Annot. in <hi>2.</hi> Tim. cap. <hi>4.</hi> verſ. <hi>8.</hi>

               <p>BEFORE we come to joine iſſue, let this maxime of arguing be obſerued: He that vvil proue one to be the proper diſciple of any Sect-maſter, muſt doe it by producing the proper and peculiar

For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if I would proue a Proteſtant to be an Arrian, I muſt not thinke to performe it, by prouing that they beleeued in one God as the Arrians did, or that they flie to the touch-ſtone of the Scriptures, as the Arrians did, refuſing Traditions; and that they relied much on the power of temporal Princes, ſetting the Biſhop of Romes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority at naught, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for none of theſe be proper branches of the Arrian ſect, but common to them with others.

                  <hi>Chriſtian people with religious ſolemnity doe celebrate the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Martirs, aſwel to ſtirre vp an imitation of their vertues, as to be made partakers of their merits, and to be holpen with their praiers; yet ſo, as we doe erect Altars only vnto the God of Martirs, though in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Martirs. For what Prelate or Priest ſeruing at the Altar, in the place of their holy bodies, hath at any time ſaid, we offer vnto thee</hi> Peter, <hi>or</hi> Paul, <hi>or</hi> Cyprian? <hi>but that which is offered, is offered to God, who hath crowned the Martirs, and is offered at the memorial or relikes of them whom he hath crowned; to the end that by the admonition of thoſe places, there may ariſe greater deuotion to inflame our charity, both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes them whom we may imitate, and alſo towardes him, by whoſe helpe we may be enabled ſo to doe. Therefore we doe worſhip the Martirs, with that reuerence and respect, with which holy men (whoſe harts we thinke ready to ſuffer as much for the truth of Chriſt) are in this life worſhipped; yet with this difference, that we doe more deuoutly worſhip the Saints, of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:14423:119"/> whoſe vertues we are aſſured, and who doe now triumph in heauen, then we doe thoſe that are yet combating in the field of this life: but with that worſhip which in Greeke is called</hi> Latria, <hi>(and hath no one proper Latin word, it being a certaine worſhip properly due vnto the God-head) neither doe we worſhip, or teach to be worſhipped, any other then God alone. And whereas the offering of ſacrifice, doth properly appertaine to this kinde of worſhip, (whence their act that offer it to Idols is called Idolatry) we doe not in any caſe offer any ſuch thing, or command any ſuch offering to be made vnto Martirs, nor to any other; and if any man fal into that errour, he is reproued by this ſound doctrine, that he may be amended or auoided:</hi> hitherto <hi>S. Auguſtine.</hi> Now let the vpright reader conſider wel of this ſacred and ſound doctrine, deliuered by the beſt learned in the pure eſtate of the primitiue Church, and then judge vvhether the preſent Roman Church, doth teach any other vvorſhipping of Saints at this day. We worſhip Saints in heauen, vvith a kinde of holy and religious vvorſhip, for their holy and religious vertues: ſo did the good Chriſtians in <hi>S. Auguſtines</hi> daies, <hi>With a religious ſolemnity,</hi> and <hi>with greater deuotion, then they did the Godlieſt and most holy men aliue.</hi> We doe teach vvord by word after <hi>S. Auguſtine;</hi> that <hi>with that kinde of worſhip which is proper to God alone,</hi> (vvhich for vvant of a proper Latin word we cal <hi>Latria) God only is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped.</hi> Another kinde of vvorſhip, (which for diſtinction ſake we cal <hi>Dulia</hi> of <hi>Doulos,</hi> that in Greeke ſignifieth a ſeruant) we doe exhibit as due to Gods ſeruants, which is infinitely leſſe, then that vvhich we giue vnto the ſoueraigne Lord and Maſter of Men and Angels. Now becauſe the worſhip due by ſacrifice, is a recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of his ſoueraigne dominion ouer vs, to vvhom we doe offer ſacrifice, and of our ſubjection to him as to our ſoueraigne Lord; therefore to God alone ſacrifice is to be offered: Yet as you haue heard out of <hi>S. Auguſtine, Sacrifice is principally to be offered at the relikes and memorial of Martirs and Saints, and in their remembrances;</hi> that we may thereby be <hi>made partakers of their merits, holpen with their praiers,</hi> and <hi>alſo inflamed with a feruent deſire of following their excellent vertues:</hi> Note by the way the antiquity of the Chriſtians offering ſacrifice, of communicating the merits of Martirs to others, of the helpe of the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ints praiers. Now if any vvould offer ſacrifice to the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> or attribute to her any other part of that honour, vvhich is proper to God alone, we would be as ready to
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:14423:120"/> checke and reproue them, as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> then was to confute the fooliſh female Collyridians.</p>
               <p>To returne to <hi>M. Abbot:</hi> vvhere were his wits when he cited out of his authour theſe wordes, <hi>The holy Virgin is to be in honour, yet not to be worſhipped?</hi> for had he but marked wel thoſe wordes, he might eaſily haue perceiued, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> did not miſlike with al kinde of worſhip that was giuen to that moſt bleſſed Virgin, ſeing that he vvould haue her to be honoured, which is a higher kinde of reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence then ordinary worſhip is; for to be honourable, is more then to be worſhipful, as euery man meanely ſeene in titles doth know: vvherefore <hi>M. Abbot</hi> cannot be excuſed from a foule fault, in that he hath tranſlated the Latin word <hi>adorare</hi> and <hi>adoratio,</hi> into bare and naked <hi>worſhip;</hi> for in that place it is taken for Diuine and Godly worſhip, as al the circumſtances of the place doe conuince. And then yet more ſottiſhly doth he ground al his objections, vpon his owne corrupt tranſlation of the ſame word: for if he had engliſhed the word <hi>adoratio</hi> ſincerely, for <hi>diuine honour,</hi> as in that place it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, he had not had any colour of this ſlander; for then he muſt haue ſaid thus: <hi>The Collyridians were adjudged Heretikes for adoring or worſhipping with diuine honour the Virgin</hi> MARY, and ſo of the reſt. But we Catholikes doe not giue to her any diuine honour, neither doe we offer ſacrifice vnto her, or vnto any Saint, as <hi>M. Abbot</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth, but to God alone: ſee more of this in the Queſtion of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. True it is, that we cal that bleſſed Virgin <hi>Queene of heauen,</hi> treading therein in the ſteps of the moſt ancient, learned, and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fathers, <hi>S. Athanaſius, S. Gregory Nazianzene, S. Bazil, S. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſostome,</hi> and others, vvhoſe wordes I haue cited in the Queſtion of worſhipping of Saints. And the reaſons why ſhee may be called Queene of heauen, be diuers: firſt, ſhee is Mother to the King of heauen IESVS Chriſt; and the Kinges Mother is ordinarily ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Queene. Secondly, euery true Chriſtian indued with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God,<note place="margin">

Thirdly, the Spouſe of the King of heauen may in good ſence be called Queene of heauen; but euery good ſoule (much more the moſt ſacred Virgin of Virgins) is the Spouſe of Chriſt: vvhich is confirmed by the Royal Prophet, where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:14423:120"/> as it were the bleſſed Virgin MARY, ſtanding at the right hand of her Sonne in his Kingdome, and intituleth her Queene;<note place="margin">

               <p>M. ABBOT comes now to make an end of his ſlanders and falſe imputations, againſt the preſent Catholike Roman Church, after the ſame ſort as he hath heretofore vſed, to wit; with wreſted and vntrue reportes of the old Heretikes opinions, and the ancient Fathers refutations of them. The Pelagians did teach indeed, that it was poſſible to keepe Gods Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements, but therefore they were not accounted Heretikes; for the ſame doth both <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>S. Hierome</hi> (that writ againſt them) approue and confirme in many places: I wil touch ſome of each of them. <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing alleaged certaine texts of holy Scripture to proue the ſame, doth conclude thus: <hi>By theſe and innumerable other teſtimonies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Peccatis, Meritis, &amp; Remiſsione, lib. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doubt, either that God hath commanded man, any thing that is impoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him to doe; or that it is impoſsible for God, to helpe man to fulfil whatſoeuer he hath commanded him: and therefore a man holpen by God,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:14423:123"/> may if he wil be without ſinne.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Grat. &amp; l. Arbit. ca. <hi>16.</hi>
                  </note> And in another place: <hi>It is certaine that we may keepe Gods Commandements if we wil.</hi> Againe, <hi>Grace is giuen vs, not becauſe we did good workes before, but that we may be able to doe them;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Spirit. &amp; Liter. ca. <hi>10.</hi>
                  </note> that is, (as he expoundeth himſelfe) <hi>Non quia legem impleui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, ſed vt legem implere poſsimus: Not becauſe we did</hi> (before we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued grace) <hi>fulfil the law, but that we may be able afterward to fulfil the law.</hi> Can any thing be more manifeſt, then that (according vnto <hi>S. Auguſtines</hi> opinion) a man indued with Gods grace, may keepe al his Commandements, and fulfil the law? The very ſame doth <hi>S. Hierome</hi> confeſſe, in that very Treatiſe cited by <hi>M. Abbot,</hi> adding this reaſon: <hi>We confeſſe that God giueth vs Commandements poſſible to be fulfilled, leaſt God ſhould be authour of injuſtice, if be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted of vs to doe that which cannot be done:</hi> ſo that the preſent Church of Rome, doth herein follow <hi>S. Augustine</hi> and <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> a noble paire of moſt learned Patrones of the ancient Church of Rome: And doth nothing leſſe then agree with <hi>Pelagius,</hi> in his errours ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that matter, which were two. The firſt, <hi>That without the helpe of Gods grace a man may keepe al Gods Commandements.</hi> The ſecond, <hi>That a man could keepe al the Commandements ſo perfectly, that be needed neuer to ſinne ſo much as venially.</hi> Which two erronious branches of <hi>Pelagius</hi> doctrine, we doe condemne as roundly, as did the moſt holy Fathers; and conſequently that a man comming to yeares of diſcretion, is <hi>anamarticos, without ſinne:</hi> for <hi>if the juſtest man aliue, ſay that he is without ſinne,</hi> (that is ſome venial ſinne) <hi>he is euen thereby made a liar,</hi> (as <hi>S. Iohn</hi> witneſſeth) <hi>and therefore a ſinner.</hi> Al this Pelagian doctrine, the preſent Church of Rome doth as wel reproue, as did the former: Marry, to affirme (as <hi>M. Abbot</hi> doth) that <hi>Pelagius</hi> was of old co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned, for affirming <hi>children to be made without ſinne by baptiſme,</hi> is (ſauing your reuerence) a ſtarke lie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted and confuted by <hi>S.

If it be a ſhame to bely the Deuil, vvhat impudency and impiety is it to bely moſt reuerend, holy, and learned Doctors; and which much increaſeth that hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous crime, thereby to blinde Chriſtian people, and to draw them along with him to the bottomeleſſe pit of hel? It hath (I willingly confeſſe) more <hi>troubled me</hi> to ſpend my ſpare time in diſcouering vntruthes, and diſhoneſt ſhifts &amp; trickes, then it ſhould haue done to haue beſtowed it in ſubſtantial arguing, and in round debating of queſtions in controuerſie, with ſhort and ſound arguments. But (I hope) by this, the vpright reader hath ſeene, that <hi>M. Abbot</hi> was ſo farre off from troubling me to proue, <hi>The principal pillars of the Roman Church in her most flouriſhing eſtate, to haue taught the ſame do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that the preſent Church of Rome no teacheth;</hi> that he hath rather furthered it, by miniſtring vnto me ſo fit an occaſion: yea (omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting others which I could chooſe my ſelf for my better aduantage) I haue not refuſed, to verifie and make good the preſent doctrine of that Church, euen by the teſtimony of thoſe very authours, of vvhich <hi>M.

If then by their verdict, who are thought by our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, to be moſt eſtranged from vs, our cauſe is confirmed and proued to be moſt juſt and veritable; vvho is ſo careleſſe of his owne ſaluation, that had rather follow a lying Maſter leading to perdition, then to imbrace ſo manifeſt a truth drawing towardes ſaluation?

               <p>He recuiles backe to Indulgences, and multiplieth his demands about one and the ſame matter; like to a Cooke that hauing but one ſort of meate to ſerue in, doth mince it into many mammocks, and then make thereof ſundry diſhes: <hi>Can the Pope</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for ſaying ſuch or ſuch praiers, or for doing this or that, releaſe a man from Purgatory, for an hundreth or a thouſand yeares?</hi> What a queſtion is this? if the Pope can diſtribute indulgences, as hath beene before proued, no doubt but he can the rather doe it, by injoyning the party that receiueth them, to ſay vvithal ſome praiers, or to doe ſome other good vvorkes; for thereby the party doth the better deſerue to be made partaker of the other grace: <hi>But can he releaſe a ſoule out of Purgatory, for a thouſand yeares?</hi> Yes marry can he, and that too not for ſome certaine number of yeares, but for euer and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. The reaſon is; for that the ſoules there, are members of the ſame body that we are, and there capable of the ſame graces of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, vvhereof alſo they ſtand in very great neede, according to the truth of Chriſtian doctrine, howſoeuer the Proteſtants doe erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly thinke the contrary: reade the Queſtion of Purgatory. And touching the preſent purpoſe, among many other pardons graunted by <hi>S. Gregory</hi> the great, there is to be ſeene vntil this day, one Altar by him erected, in the Monaſtery of <hi>S. Andrewes</hi> in Rome, where he was himſelfe firſt Nouice and afterwardes Abbot; where at vvhoſoeuer ſaid Maſſe for a ſoule in Purgatory, ſhal deliuer one there-hence.</p>
               <p>Concerning <hi>the Iubilee,</hi> which is free and ful pardon graunted once in fiue and twenty yeares, vnto euery one that ſhal viſit ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Churches in Rome that yeare, ſome fifteene times or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts; what new difficulty can there be about that? yea it is as the moſt renowmed pardon that is graunted, ſo the moſt reaſonable: for it can be obtained but once in fiue and twenty yeares, and then
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:14423:126"/> exceeding hardly, by vnder going a long, coſtly, and painful jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to the citty of Rome, and by exerciſing there al the workes of piety and mercy; as faſting, praying, and giuing of almes, making general confeſſion, and receiuing the bleſſed Sacrament, and often viſiting of many Churches and Altars. Thoſe moſt godly meanes of training men to true repentance and ſatisfaction for their former faults, and amendme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of their liues, if the Proteſtant religion were acquainted withal, there would be among them ſome checke and ſtoppe of their vvicked courſes. But if they vvil needes ſinne on themſelues, and neuer giue ouer nor amend vntil Gods judgments fal vpon them: yet let them not be offended at vs, that doe aduiſe al men to labour in time for ſuch indulgences, that they may eſcape the due puniſhment of their ſinnes, either in this vvorld or in the next. Is it not alſo moſt probable and likely, if thoſe good ſoules (vvho to doe ſome ſatisfaction for their former euil liues, and to ſerue God more deuoutly in thoſe holy places, where ſome of the holy Apoſtles, and an innumerable company of valiant Martirs and holy Confeſſors liued and died) doe die by the way in that Godly purpoſe, that they are <hi>carried by Angels to heauen,</hi> as <hi>Lazarus</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Paradiſe? we pray to God to command ſuch by his holy Angels to be brought into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, as may be ſeene in the Maſſe for the dead. But <hi>Balaeus</hi> in Latin, and <hi>Bale</hi> the Iriſh Apoſtata in Engliſh, <hi>M. Abbots</hi> worthy authour reporteth, that <hi>Clement the ſixt himſelfe, did command the Angels to carry them into Paradiſe.</hi> No great regard is to be had vvhat ſuch a lying lewd fellow relates, and ſo I thinke him vnworthy any other anſwere. Touching <hi>Canonization of Saints</hi> we hold, that the Biſhops of the prouinces vvhere their vertuous liues and moſt godly deathes (co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by miracles) are beſt knowne, did alwaies from the beginning of chriſtian religion, declare and teſtifie to the Church, that they were to be eſteemed of al men for Saints. Since, it hath beene found moſt expedient, that the vvhole courſe of the life and death of ſuch (being by moſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent inquiſition tried out, and taken in the places of their aboade) be afterwardes ſent to Rome, there to be alſo throughly examined firſt, and then accordingly to be declared Saints, by the higheſt Paſtor of the Church; that no man of any other country, might afterwards doubt of their ſo approued ſanctity. To <hi>M. Abbots</hi> que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion I then anſwere; that euen by the order of <hi>S. Peter</hi> and <hi>S. Paul,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And it is one of <hi>M.

               <p>Now becauſe <hi>M.

I know that he would not be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ignorant, and he ſeemes to haue read both <hi>Proclus</hi> and <hi>Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> vvordes; but he jumbleth them togither as though they were owne text, though they ſtand in ſeueral diuiſions with <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and ſome of them foure or fiue great leaues from the other. And yet me thinkes, he ſhould not be ſo ſimple and ſhallow witted, as to haue read them both ouer, and not to diſcerne vvhere <hi>Proclus</hi> ſpeech endeth: for <hi>Epiphanius</hi> doth moſt diſtinctly point out the beginning and the end of <hi>Proclus</hi> diſcourſe, with ſuch a beginning of <hi>Methodius</hi> confutation of it, that any man vnderſtanding the Latin tongue, and enjoying the right vſe of his eyes, cannot chooſe but perceiue it. For <hi>Epiphanius</hi> hauing (vnder this title: <hi>Now follow the wordes of</hi> Proclus, <hi>which</hi> Methodius <hi>doth alſo rehearſe, as he had done before the words of Origen</hi>) put downe <hi>Proclus</hi> diſcourſe at length, doth at the end of it make a diſtinction, with this admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition: <hi>Sequuntur deinceps ipſius</hi> Methodij <hi>verba, Now follow the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:14423:132"/> wordes of</hi> Methodius <hi>himſelfe;</hi> thitherto then vvent the vvordes of <hi>Proclus,</hi> wherein al <hi>M. Abbots</hi> helpe and reliefe is comprehended: therefore <hi>Proclus</hi> the heretike by his owne acknowledgment is his authour, and not <hi>Methodius</hi> the Catholike Biſhop. Againe, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beginning of <hi>Methodius</hi> diſcourſe (if there were not ſo diſtinct a ſeperation and admonition of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſet downe) vvould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, that al before vvas <hi>Proclus</hi> diſcourſe, and that there he firſt beganne his owne: theſe be his vvordes. <hi>Cùm igitur vix deſijſſet Proclus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Therefore when</hi> Proclus <hi>had ſcarce finiſhed, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory was long ſilent, as very much inclined to giue credit to</hi> Proclus <hi>ſpeech: I ſeeing them ſo ſtil, beganne to lift vp my head faire and ſoft, and to take breath as men at the Sea vſe to doe after the tempest is paſt; and trembling as ſome-thing Sea-ſicke (for I must needes confeſſe my ſelfe to haue beene ſtrooken with the vehemency of his Oration) I turne my ſelfe to</hi> Auxentius <hi>and ſay. O friend, it was not in vaine ſaid by the Poët: If two goe joyned togither, for our aduerſaries be two; wherefore I craue your helpe in this combate, that we may be alſo two to reſiſt them, leaſt that</hi> Aglaophon <hi>armed with the perſwaſiue ſpeeches of</hi> Origen <hi>and</hi> Proclus, <hi>doe wreſt out of our handes the true reſurrection. Goe to then, let vs range our battaile againſt their ſophiſmes, nothing appaled at thoſe encounters, wherewith the feareful are daunted:</hi> and ſo goeth on with his pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, preparing towardes the confutation of <hi>Proclus.</hi> And being ready to giue the on-ſet, asketh his partner <hi>Auxentius</hi> vvhether it pleaſe him to beginne: <hi>Vtrum igitur</hi> (Auxenti) <hi>tu huius viae dux eſse velis, and ego praecedam? Whether wil you be the guide of the way, or ſhal I goe before? Who anſwered him, That it was meete becauſe he beganne the ſpeech, that he ſhould alſo march before. Goe to then</hi> (ſaith Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius) <hi>let vs for our part examine that matter euen from the beginning for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:</hi> hitherto <hi>Methodius.</hi> Doe not al theſe circumſtances moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently conuince and demonſtrate, to him that is not more then poore-blinde, that vnto the beginning of thoſe his ſpeeches, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clus</hi> former Oration continued? note the vvordes, <hi>When</hi> Proclus <hi>had ſcarce made an end.</hi> Againe, <hi>Methodius</hi> would not beginne to contend againſt two, that is, <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Proclus,</hi> til he had gotten <hi>Auxentius</hi> to joine his forces vvith him, that they might be two to two. Moreouer, after many other complements, <hi>Methodius</hi> would haue had <hi>Auxentius</hi> to haue made the firſt ſally forth, and to haue giuen the firſt charge vpon <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Proclus,</hi> vvhich he refuſing
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:14423:133"/> to doe, <hi>Methodius</hi> beganne. Now let any man judge, whether my lips hanged in my light (as <hi>M. Abbots</hi> ciuility lead him to ſpeake) or whether his ſoare eies rather, vvere not ſtrangely diſtempered, that he could not ſee <hi>Proclus</hi> diſcourſe to haue laſted vntil that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of <hi>Methodius;</hi> being ſo diſtinguiſhed by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and by ſuch apparant ſignes of diſtinction marked out by <hi>Methodius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe? If neede vvere, I could proue by the coherence and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence, of the beginning and ending of <hi>Proclus</hi> ſpeeches, that they laſted not only for a few lines in the beginning, as <hi>M. Abbot</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth; but vntil the end of fiue ful leaues. For <hi>Proclus</hi> purpoſe was to proue, <hi>That the Reſurrection could not be in the ſubſtance of this mortal body, wherein we liue; which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>cannot remaine for euer without change and be immortal; but the Reſurrection must be in a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and immortal body, which yet ſhould haue the ſame outward ſhape and proportion that our mortal bodies haue,</hi> euen as <hi>Origin</hi> hath taught: This I affirme to be the opinion and propoſition of <hi>Proclus;</hi> where vnto <hi>M. Abbot</hi> alſo conſenteth. Now this very ſame is his conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion fiue leaues after, where he endeth his diſcourſe, vvith a fond compariſon of our mortal bodies vnto a beaſts-hide filled vvith vvater. <hi>Which skinne</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>though the water be often changed, doth neuerthel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:14423:133"/> ſame fleſh and bones it had before; Euen ſo ſhould euery other Chriſtian mans body doe. Nay</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>not ſo: for Chriſts body was not concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in ſinne as ours are, but of the holy Ghoſt and of a Virgin; but our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are ſleepe, pleaſure, and filth: and therefore (according to the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of wiſe Syrach) to be deuoured of wormes, and conſumed:</hi> So that to the very laſt vvordes before <hi>(Now follow the wordes of Methodius)</hi> there is no ſigne of a confutation, but a plentiful confirmation of <hi>Proclus</hi> errour, vvhich was; That the ſame body of ours, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the inward ſubſtance of it, ſhal not riſe againe in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reſurrection, but only according to the outward ſhape. Now, one reaſon among the reſt, that moued that doating Originiſt to beleeue, that the ſame body of ours in ſubſtance ſhould not riſe againe, was forſooth: <hi>That original ſinne had ſo infected this body of ours, and was ſo faſt riuited or rather incorporated with it, that it could neuer be cleanſed and ridde cleane out, vnleſſe the body alſo it ſelfe, were vtterly deſtroied and extinguiſhed with it:</hi> vvhich he aſſaieth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme with that ſentence of the Apoſtle (ſo common in the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants mouthes) <hi>There is not in me</hi> (that is, in my fleſh) <hi>any good.</hi> Now to the Minor propoſition of <hi>Proclus:</hi> but <hi>in the Reſurrection there must be a pure body, moſt cleane from al contagion of ſinne; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not this body of ours (which cannot be without ſinne) muſt needes be vtterly conſumed, and a new ſpiritual body framed.</hi> This was one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal foundation of <hi>Proclus</hi> enormious opinion, in which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants jump with him; that whiles this body of ours liueth, ſinne is neuer rooted out of it: <hi>It may be</hi> (ſay they, as alſo <hi>Proclus</hi> there ſaid before them) <hi>checked or cropped in vs, or not imputed to vs: but it cannot whiles we liue be cleane purged and rooted out.</hi> Finally, this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry argument of <hi>Proclus,</hi> which <hi>M. Abbot</hi> would father vpon <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodius,</hi> is in the enſuing diſcourſe of <hi>Methodius</hi> towardes the end croſſed and confuted: vvhere he teacheth out of the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>That by the law of the ſpirit of God, and through the vertue of Chriſtes grace, that ſinne which was in our bodies, is condemned to death;</hi> that is, ouercome, vanquiſhed, and killed.</p>
               <p>Theſe arguments taken out of the moſt material circumſtances of this diſcourſe (as of that which goeth before it, and doth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately follow after, with the principal aſſertion in it ſelf, ſet downe both in the beginning and ending of it) muſt needes perſwade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny indifferent reader, that <hi>M. Abbot</hi> vvas wonderfully careleſſe of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:14423:134"/> his credit, to thruſt out ſuch an impudent aſſertion, ſo contrary to al likeneſſe of truth, that any man that wil but haue the patience to reade ouer ſo long chapters, may moſt eaſily diſcouer the falſhood of it. One poore colour <hi>M. Abbot</hi> found out to deceiue himſelfe and others, that it was no continuation of <hi>Proclus</hi> ſpeech: <hi>Becauſe</hi> (forſooth) <hi>Proclus ſeemeth to confute Origens</hi> expoſition <hi>of the coates of skinne, which God made for</hi> Adam. Origen <hi>tooke them to ſignifie this body of ours;</hi> Proclus <hi>not ſo, but only to notifie the ſame bodies to be then firſt made mortal:</hi> but this ſhadow of a reaſon is ſo ſimple, that it vvil not fray a babe. For it often falleth out, that the ſcholler of an erronious teacher, vvil not vvholy agree with his maſter; but though he follow him in the maine point of his doctrine, yet he vvil haue ſome one tricke or other of his owne aboue him: ſo <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clus,</hi> albeit he ſtood ſtoutly to <hi>Origen,</hi> in the denial of the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the ſame body in ſubſtance, vvhich was the head contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie; yet did he diſſent from him in the expoſition of the coates of skinnes, vvhich was but an appendix to the other. But this proues not <hi>Proclus</hi> diſcourſe to be that of <hi>Methodius;</hi> nay it plainly diſproues it: for <hi>Methodius</hi> giueth a third interpretation of thoſe skinnes, differing from both the other, vvhich is alſo farre more litteral then the other two; to wit, <hi>That the skinnes were made by God for our first parents, to couer their nakedneſſe, and to keepe them from the cold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude this Section; ſeing there be ſo manifold great and plaine reaſons againſt <hi>M. Abbot,</hi> and he hauing no better ſhelter for his ſurmiſe, then that ſilly ſhift vvhich you haue heard, of the <hi>diuers interpretation of the skinnes;</hi> ſeemeth he not to be paſt al ſhame and vvorthy to be thruſt into an Aſſes skinne, that hereupon takes an occaſion to inſult againſt me, as though he had gotten a mighty victory?<note place="margin">

Biſhops <hi>wits, that could thinke that theſe were the wordes of</hi> Proclus? <hi>Surely be read the place very early in the morning, before he had his ful ſleepe; or late after ſupper, when he ſhould haue beene in bedde; or elſe he borrowed them from ſome of his Maſters the Ieſuites, who make as little conſcience what they ſay, as he doth. We muſt be content with ſuch ſtuffe as he can yeeld vs: The broker can afford no other wares, then he himſelfe had receiued of the marchant.</hi> See how pleaſant and plentiful the man is, vpon very ſmal aduantage, nay vpon no aduantage at al; but only vpon the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:14423:134"/> diſplaying of his owne groſſe ignorance, or too too great ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight. I am ſo farre off, from taking this vpon the bare report of others, that beſides the diligent reading of the Latin tranſlation of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> I haue looked alſo into his owne Greeke text: vvhere I finde the ſame diſtinctions. Firſt, <hi>Proclus</hi> wordes with this title, <hi>Proclou tou Autou;</hi> the wordes of <hi>Proclus</hi> himſelfe: and after them an entire continuation of the ſame, vvithout any ſigne of interru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, for more then foure ful leaues. And then in another diſtinct ſeperation, <hi>Loipon tou Methodiou,</hi> the reſt, or that which followeth is of <hi>Methodius.</hi> Betweene which two partitions, al the diſcourſe is of <hi>Proclus</hi> owne deuiſe, out of which <hi>M. Abbot</hi> draweth for their defence ſome ſentences; and being aſhamed (as good cauſe he had) of ſuch a ſhameful Patrone, he vvould gladly haue fathered that badde diſcourſe vpon <hi>Methodius,</hi> a reuerend Catholike Biſhop: ſee, and wonder at the blinde folly of Proteſtants, that bluſh not to maintaine Heretikes opinions very ſtoutly, and yet are aſhamed of the name and company of the Heretikes themſelues. Either let them hardly auouch thoſe authours vvorthy to be reſpected, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, and followed; or elſe hartily and happily giue ouer, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, and deteſt thoſe their damnable opinions, which made them vnto al holy and learned Antiquity, exceeding odious. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vviſe they maintaining the very ſelfe ſame errours, muſt needes in the end proue vnto al vpright and wel vnderſtanding men, in like manner infamous; and be no leſſe hated and auoided of al good Chriſtians, then their founders and maſters vvere before them. Thus farre of <hi>Proclus</hi> the Originiſt, vvhom <hi>M.

               <p>Now I come vnto his 34.

               <p>THIS light ſcoffing inuectiue of his, moſt fit for the grauity of ſuch a jolly Preacher and a Doctor, I would haue buried in deepe ſilence, as vnworthy any ſerious anſwere, had he not al his booke ouer beene glanſing and girding at thoſe few vvordes of mine, as though they contained no leſſe then high treaſon; hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling alſo vvith them many odious imputations, and ſpiteful ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of vs and our doctrine. The diſcreet reader wil (I hope) beare with me, if I doe anſwere the man ſome-what ſutable to his owne ſtile. The general ſcope of my Epiſtle was, to moue his Majeſty to fauour the Catholike religion, at leaſt to mitigate the rigour of his Highneſſe lawes enacted againſt Catholikes. Among ſundry other reaſons which I produced to that purpoſe, it was one; to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate an inconuenience that might happen to follow, vpon the ſeuere execution of the ſaid extreme penalties: vvherein I cannot conceiue, how <hi>M.

For who almoſt, is ſo little acquainted with the diſpoſitions of great ſtates, but that he knoweth, how they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire rather to heare of preſent applaudites, praiſes, and congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then of any future perils, troubles, and diſquietneſſe? where<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore this infelicity is eſteemed by the vviſe, to be linked with the flouriſhing and moſt fortunate place of Princes; that they ſhal find very few ready to admoniſh them of things diſtaſtful, vvhich may happe rather to ingender melancholy, then to purchaſe any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity: moſt men being very couetous to winde themſelues into their good liking (from vvhom deſcend ſo many promotions and profits,) by preſenting vnto them pleaſant and delightful objects. It had then rather beene a point of humane pollicy, to haue abſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the mention of ſuch an vngrateful matter, and to haue tendered only pleaſing arguments, as <hi>M.

               <p>True it is, that <hi>we Catholikes are no changlings in matters of faith,</hi> and in rite of Sacraments. The ſame vvhich our fore-fathers and eldeſt anceſtours, imbraced and held euen from the Apoſtles daies; that, and no other, doe we inuiolably obſerue and maintaine vnto this day: And what is taught among vs in one country for matter of faith, the ſame is generally receiued, by men of our religional the vvorld ouer. We be not (God be thanked) herein like the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:14423:136"/> Proteſtants; who, as though they had taken their name of <hi>Proteus,</hi> are as changeable in articles of faith, as he is fained to haue beene various in the transforming of his countenance: In Germany be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing one thing, in Heluetia another; at Geneua turning the third way, in Holland vvandering the fourth. How many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries they infect with their new and prophane Goſpel: ſo many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers profeſſions of faith, and diſtinct formes of Church gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they haue. Theſe <hi>changlinges</hi> that are ſo farre degenerated from their predeceſſors piety, and doe diſagree ſo much one with another: Yea; that doe in the ſame country often chop and change their owne religion; are of al conſtant Catholikes <hi>to be auoided, as vnſtable and wauering ſoules, caried about with euery blast of new doctrine.</hi> But concerning dutiful obedience vnto the Prince, vvho is Gods Lieutenant general in temporal cauſes, Catholikes if they be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to Proteſtants, wil be found an hundred times more loyal and conſtant: vvhich point becauſe I haue touched in my anſwere vnto <hi>M. Abbots</hi> Epiſtle in the beginning of this booke, I neede not here againe handle it at large. And although ſome men of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, haue now and then (as fraile and ſinneful creatures) forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten their duty both to God and their King: yet they haue beene ſo few, and that ſo ſeldome in compariſon of the Proteſtants, that for one of ours, more then a thouſand of theirs, haue within this hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares failed therein; though we be in number, a thouſand of our religion for one of theirs, if you take al Chriſtendome ouer.</p>
               <p>And albeit <hi>the ſtate ſeeme now to be ſettled</hi> againſt the religion of our fore-fathers, and not vnlike ſo to continue, vntil it ſhal pleaſe God of his infinite mercies to alter and amend it; vvhich notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding (as al the faithful know) may be very ſhortly, becauſe his diuine power is infinite, and no man able to reſiſt his vvil: yet we ſhal be by the aſſiſtance of Gods good grace, ſo farre off from <hi>biting our tongues,</hi> or the lip either thereat as <hi>M. Abbot</hi> fondly imagineth; that vve wil rather pray to God to open our lips, and to looſe our tongues to magnifie his holy name, that he hath giuen vs that true Chriſtian happineſſe and honour, not only<note place="margin">

But very great ſorow and continual ſadneſſe of hart haue we to conſider, that Chriſtian religion firſt planted in our country, and euer ſince vntil our fathers daies moſt conſtantly continued, is now baniſhed thence; and with it al ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty of life, al good and charitable dealing with our neighbour, is vtterly decaied and baniſhed out of the City and Country: And in place thereof, ſwearing, and forſwearing, drunkenneſſe, diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, and al manner of deceit and knauery, openly practiſed, countenanced, and without bluſhing profeſſed. That the goodly, faire, and ſtately Churches (built by our Catholike Anceſtors, for Catholike aſſemblies at the bleſſed ſacrifice of the Maſſe, and for the due adminiſtration of the holy Sacraments, and true preaching of Gods word) be now prophaned and turned to places of diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring of our ſoueraigne Creatour, and of ſeducing his poore creatures. That the famous Vniuerſities and other Schooles foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for inſtruction principally of Catholike doctrine and deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be now made ſhops of new errours, looſe manners, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety. Vpon theſe and ſuch like ſpiritual conſiderations, finding our poore country depriued in manner of al Gods bleſſings, and our deare country-men made ſlaues of the Deuil, and fuel for the flames of hel fire; vve Catholikes are exceeding penſiue, yet doe

Abbot</hi> ſcornefully vvriteth: but doe in bitterneſſe of ſoule moſt earneſtly pray vnto the Father of mercies (in vvhoſe handes are the harts of al Kinges) to inſpire our dread ſoueraigne King IAMES, and the Lordes of his moſt honourable Councel, vvith the true knowledge of his ſacred vvil and word: and to kindle in them ſo feruent a zeale of the Catholike Roman faith, as that they may imploy thoſe very rare and ſingular gifts of nature, arte, and experience, which God hath plentifully powred vpon them, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the reclaiming of our country from the new prophane he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, and moſt wicked conuerſation of theſe miſerable times, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Anceſtours ſound faith, ſincere honeſty, and moſt charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and vpright dealing: (This chiefly is the heape of our heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, this is al the harme vve wiſh them, this is al the treaſon that can be juſtly laid to our charge.) That vvith the aboundance of ſuch honour and proſperity as this vale of miſery affordeth them, they might alſo be heires of eternal happineſſe, glory and felicity. And albeit for this ineſtimable heauenly bliſſe, vvhich we moſt hartily deſire vnto our natiue ſoile and beſt beloued country, we be ſtiled a thouſand times traitours, and euery way vſed moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly; yet we ſhal not ſurceaſſe by Gods grace to pray for them continually, vvho doe day and night perſecute vs: yea ouer and beſides, be ready alſo by the aſſiſtance of the ſame his grace, not only to beſtow our beſt and moſt ſeruiceable daies to doe them good; but alſo the deareſt bloud in our bodies, if it ſhal pleaſe our bleſſed Sauiour ſo to diſpoſe of vs.</p>
               <p>And is it likely? that men thus by the grace of God affected, ſhould cry out (as <hi>M. Abbot</hi> malitiouſly ſurmiſeth) <hi>O fallaces ſpes!

               <p>HERE we are rather to note the ignorance ſhal I ſay, or impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of a ſhameleſſe railing Miniſter, that catcheth at al oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to cauil at our doctrine, how little congruity ſoeuer there be in the coherence of his owne ſpeeches: for ſmal reaſon had he, to leape from my wordes of ſo modeſt ſignification, vnto thoſe of the right famous Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> vvith which they haue no affinity or reſemblance. For I only inſinuate an inconuenience that may proceede, out of the frailty and corruption of ſome impatient men: vvhereas he ſeemeth to teach what may be done vpon good aduiſe juſtly. And that you may vnderſtand the vveakeneſſe of <hi>M. Abbots</hi> judgement, vvho would make the Cardinals wordes directly oppoſite to <hi>Tertullians</hi> doctrine, obſerue; that they be not ſo contrary, as he (through the fault of his ſoare eies) doth miſtake them. For <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith not, that <hi>Neroes</hi> and <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taes
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:14423:142"/> ſubjects, and ſuch like, would haue depoſed their Princes if they had had power: <hi>But that they might lawfully haue ſo done.</hi> Now if you marke wel <hi>Tertullians</hi> vvordes, he ſeemeth not to diſſent much there-fro: <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with vs it is more tollerable to be killed, then to kil.</hi> Out of vvhich wordes it may rather be gathered, that he held it alſo tollerable for thoſe Chriſtians, to make warre againſt their perſecuting Emperours; though he thought it more tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to endure euen death it ſelfe, for their religion. Neither can I perſwade my ſelfe, that the Cardinal meant that of Heathen Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ouer whom the Church hath no power to judge; but of ſuch Princes only, who had before made profeſſion of the faith, and therein promiſed obedience vnto Chriſtes Spouſe the Church, as he doth there in his fourth reaſon declare expreſly. Now I enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle not at al, with any ſuch queſtion: vvherefore, he too too crabbedly and crookedly, doth reſemble things ſo vnlike togither.</p>
               <p>That which followeth in this his Section, is but a moſt mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious exaggeration of their hainous crime, that plotted about the gunne-powder-treaſon: of which I haue ſpoken ſo largely in my anſwere to his Epiſtle (vvhere he firſt enforced it) that I neede not now againe ſtand about the confutation of it. He after his old man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner dilating his lies, maketh it not only a common conſpiracy of al Catholikes in England, but addeth: <hi>That it was alſo the effect of a conſultation held at Doway;</hi> but when, or by whom, he cannot wel tel, I weene. For al the Kinges Majeſties moſt learned Councel, hauing vſed al the diligence, that vvas poſſible for men to doe, to bolt out al the complices and circumſtances of that moſt odious enterpriſe, could tel no tidinges of any ſuch conſultation held at Doway, as al the records thereof doe teſtifie. Was it not then great pitty, that they had not ſought vnto this holy Miniſter, for their better inſtruction in ſo waighty a buſineſſe, who could haue giuen them greater light therein, (as he ſeemeth to inſinuate) then al the world beſides? Marry if one ſhould appoſe him, how he came by the knowledge of that ſecret, he would anſwere (I trow) that he had it by reuelation, from the ſpirit that poſſeſſeth his hart, to wit, the father of al lies, that old Serpent and calumniator Sathan. Out of whoſe falſe figures, he hath taken this more then Poëtical fiction which followeth in his text: <hi>O, if the Proteſtants</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>had vſed any ſuch practiſe in France, in Spaine, or any where elſe, what hidious
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:14423:143"/> noiſes and exclamations would theſe men haue raiſed there-vpon? how would they haue traduced our religion? how would they haue bent al their force, withal extremity to extirpate vtterly, not only the perſons guilty, but al that carried the name of that profeſsion?</hi> vvhat a ſenceleſſe and moſt wicked fiction is this? moſt wicked, for that it would enforce the ſlaughter and vtter ruine of many thouſands of innocents and guiltleſſe perſons, for the guilt of a dozen offenders. For he ſaith, <hi>They would vtterly roote vp, not only the guilty, but al that are of the ſame profeſsion,</hi> how innocent ſoeuer: And no leſſe ſenceleſſe is the ſame his aſſertion, and repugnant to moſt euident truth. For in France, (vvhich is the firſt country that he doth giue inſtance in) the Proteſtants haue not only plotted and gone about, but haue put in practiſe, and actually done the vttermoſt of their power, to depoſe, and ouerthrow, and ruinate, not only their lawful King, and moſt of the bloud Royal; but alſo the Catholike Peeres, Princes, Dukes, Lordes, Gentry, and Yeomanry, Clergy, and Laity. To the effecting vvhereof, beſides their owne ſtrength, and the helpe of their neighbours, they called into the bowels of their owne country, two mighty armies of Germans, with helpe vvhereof, they haue ſacked many a noble Citty, Caſtle, and Towne; and blowne vp moſt ſtately Churches, and other faire buildings, vvith fire, gunne-powder, and Cannon-ſhot. They haue rifled, ſpoiled, and ruinated many great Prouinces of that goodly Country: they haue cruelly butchered, ſlaine, and beene the cauſe of the vnjuſt death, of many hundred thouſands of Men, Women, and Children; as not only their owne Hyſtories teſtifie, but many thouſands of yet liuing eie-witneſſes can verifie. And notwithſtanding al this miſchiefe really acted and done, be al that beare the name of that profeſſion, vtterly extirpated and rooted out of that country therefore? nothing leſſe: nay they haue not only tolleration of religion, but free exerciſe thereof, openly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and graunted them. Was this man then wel in his wits, or did he know what he ſaid? vvhen he preferred that horrible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy of the gunne-powder-treaſon, before al the enormious crimes of Proteſtants, both in France and al other countries? or vvas there euer ſuch a ſhameleſſe writer as <hi>M.

Oh, into what lamentable calamity is our poore Country fallen, that muſt haue ſuch coſening Companions, ſuch falſe Hypocrites, and moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent Liars, for the guides of their ſoules to ſaluation, and for the only teachers of al ſpiritual doctrine!

For <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius Phaleius</hi> being asked what euil did follow a liar? <hi>Marry</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that no man afterward beleeue him, when he telleth truth:</hi> And good reaſon, for how knoweth he, vvhether he doe not lie then, as he was accuſtomed to doe before?

And no one more aſſured touch of counterfaite coyne: no plainer proofe of a rauening vvolfe and falſe teacher, then ſuch often and euident lying.

But if it be Gods good pleaſure, that you your ſelues ſhal make kowne to the vvorld, that yee doe not only vſe lying, but alſo defend it as lawful &amp; neceſſary to vnder-proppe your badde cauſe: then my truſt in Gods infinite goodneſſe and mercies is, that the Moone-ſhine of your obſcure Goſpel, waneth a-pace; and the daies of your deceit, draw towardes an end. For howſoeuer you like iniquity and allow of leaſinges;<note place="margin">

Wherefore, al that haue taſted of the true gifts of Chriſtes ſpirit, vvil follow them no longer, in their moſt dangerous and damnable courſes; but fly as faſt and as farre from ſuch falſe Prophets, as poore ſheepe doe from the jawes of rauening wolues, and with ſpeede returne happily vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <hi>COVRTEOVS READER,</hi> I muſt needes acquaint thee with a notable legerdemaine, which by peruſing the Authour I found out, after the reſt was printed. <hi>M. Abbot</hi> to proue that the Pope had no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in Scotland <hi>1200.</hi> yeares after Christ, auerreth:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Page</hi> 117.</note> that <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſecond vtterly for-badde the Popes Legate to enter within his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; which is not true. For his Authour <hi>Mathew Paris</hi> declareth:<note place="margin">In He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rico <hi>30</hi> page <hi>667.</hi>
               </note> that the King indeede did at the firſt oppoſe himſelfe againſt that viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Kingdome, to be made by the ſaid Legate: not for that he did not acknowledge the Popes ſupreme authority in thoſe Eccleſiaſtical cauſes; but becauſe it was needleſſe, the matters of the Church being (as he ſaid) in good order, and for feare of ouer-great charges. Nay further, the ſaid King did write a large letter vnto the Pope himſelfe, as the very ſame Authour recordeth: where he firſt acknowledgeth,<note place="margin">In He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rico <hi>30</hi> page <hi>873.</hi>
               </note> that very perſon to be his Holineſſe Legate, as wel in Scotland as in England and Ireland. Moreouer the King confeſſeth, that he himſelfe, his heires and ſubjects, were and would be obedient vnto the Popes juriſdiction and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, with much more to the ſame purpoſe. Which alone is ſufficient to conuince <hi>M. Abbot,</hi> to be ſo perfidious and without al conſcience in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaging auncient Authours, that no man who wil not willingly be blindly ledde by him, can repoſe any truſt in his allegations.</p>
            <p>Good Reader beare with faultes in printing, which beſides falſe poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, be not many. The principal that I remember are theſe:</p>
